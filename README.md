| **[Aerial-Ground Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08597v5)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-ID matches persons across multiple non-overlapping cameras. Despite the increasing deployment of airborne platforms in surveillance, current existing person re-ID benchmarks' focus is on ground-ground matching and very limited efforts on aerial-aerial matching. We propose a new benchmark dataset - AG-ReID, which performs person re-ID matching in a new setting: across aerial and ground cameras. Our dataset contains 21,983 images of 388 identities and 15 soft attributes for each identity. The data was collected by a UAV flying at altitudes between 15 to 45 meters and a ground-based CCTV camera on a university campus. Our dataset presents a novel elevated-viewpoint challenge for person re-ID due to the significant difference in person appearance across these cameras. We propose an explainable algorithm to guide the person re-ID model's training with soft attributes to address this challenge. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the aerial-ground person re-ID task. The dataset will be published and the baseline codes will be open-sourced at https://github.com/huynguyen792/AG-ReID to facilitate research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2023 (ICME2023)</p></details> |
| **[Re-ID Driven Localization Refinement for Person Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08580v1)** | 2019-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person search aims at localizing and identifying a query person from a gallery of uncropped scene images. Different from person re-identification (re-ID), its performance also depends on the localization accuracy of a pedestrian detector. The state-of-the-art methods train the detector individually, and the detected bounding boxes may be sub-optimal for the following re-ID task. To alleviate this issue, we propose a re-ID driven localization refinement framework for providing the refined detection boxes for person search. Specifically, we develop a differentiable ROI transform layer to effectively transform the bounding boxes from the original images. Thus, the box coordinates can be supervised by the re-ID training other than the original detection task. With this supervision, the detector can generate more reliable bounding boxes, and the downstream re-ID model can produce more discriminative embeddings based on the refined person localizations. Extensive experimental results on the widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art person search methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Beyond Universal Person Re-ID Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.14184v3)** | 2020-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based person re-identification (Re-ID) has made great progress and achieved high performance recently. In this paper, we make the first attempt to examine the vulnerability of current person Re-ID models against a dangerous attack method, \ie, the universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) attack, which has been shown to fool classification models with a little overhead. We propose a \emph{more universal} adversarial perturbation (MUAP) method for both image-agnostic and model-insensitive person Re-ID attack. Firstly, we adopt a list-wise attack objective function to disrupt the similarity ranking list directly. Secondly, we propose a model-insensitive mechanism for cross-model attack. Extensive experiments show that the proposed attack approach achieves high attack performance and outperforms other state of the arts by large margin in cross-model scenario. The results also demonstrate the vulnerability of current Re-ID models to MUAP and further suggest the need of designing more robust Re-ID models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black Re-ID: A Head-shoulder Descriptor for the Challenging Problem of Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08528v1)** | 2020-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims at retrieving an input person image from a set of images captured by multiple cameras. Although recent Re-ID methods have made great success, most of them extract features in terms of the attributes of clothing (e.g., color, texture). However, it is common for people to wear black clothes or be captured by surveillance systems in low light illumination, in which cases the attributes of the clothing are severely missing. We call this problem the Black Re-ID problem. To solve this problem, rather than relying on the clothing information, we propose to exploit head-shoulder features to assist person Re-ID. The head-shoulder adaptive attention network (HAA) is proposed to learn the head-shoulder feature and an innovative ensemble method is designed to enhance the generalization of our model. Given the input person image, the ensemble method would focus on the head-shoulder feature by assigning a larger weight if the individual insides the image is in black clothing. Due to the lack of a suitable benchmark dataset for studying the Black Re-ID problem, we also contribute the first Black-reID dataset, which contains 1274 identities in training set. Extensive evaluations on the Black-reID, Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets show that our model achieves the best result compared with the state-of-the-art Re-ID methods on both Black and conventional Re-ID problems. Furthermore, our method is also proved to be effective in dealing with person Re-ID in similar clothing. Our code and dataset are avaliable on https://github.com/xbq1994/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic-To-Real Video Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02108v3)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) is an important task and has significant applications for public security and information forensics, which has progressed rapidly with the development of deep learning. In this work, we investigate a novel and challenging setting of Re-ID, i.e., cross-domain video-based person Re-ID. Specifically, we utilize synthetic video datasets as the source domain for training and real-world videos for testing, notably reducing the reliance on expensive real data acquisition and annotation. To harness the potential of synthetic data, we first propose a self-supervised domain-invariant feature learning strategy for both static and dynamic (temporal) features. Additionally, to enhance person identification accuracy in the target domain, we propose a mean-teacher scheme incorporating a self-supervised ID consistency loss. Experimental results across five real datasets validate the rationale behind cross-synthetic-real domain adaptation and demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Notably, the discovery that synthetic data outperforms real data in the cross-domain scenario is a surprising outcome. The code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/XiangqunZhang/UDA_Video_ReID.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrADe Re-ID -- Live Person Re-Identification using Tracking and Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06452v1)** | 2022-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) aims to search for a person of interest (query) in a network of cameras. In the classic Re-ID setting the query is sought in a gallery containing properly cropped images of entire bodies. Recently, the live Re-ID setting was introduced to represent the practical application context of Re-ID better. It consists in searching for the query in short videos, containing whole scene frames. The initial live Re-ID baseline used a pedestrian detector to build a large search gallery and a classic Re-ID model to find the query in the gallery. However, the galleries generated were too large and contained low-quality images, which decreased the live Re-ID performance. Here, we present a new live Re-ID approach called TrADe, to generate lower high-quality galleries. TrADe first uses a Tracking algorithm to identify sequences of images of the same individual in the gallery. Following, an Anomaly Detection model is used to select a single good representative of each tracklet. TrADe is validated on the live Re-ID version of the PRID-2011 dataset and shows significant improvements over the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Accepted on ICMLA 2022</p></details> |
| **[Causality and "In-the-Wild" Video-Based Person Re-ID: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20540v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world deployments despite impressive benchmark performance. Most existing models rely on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures. In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness, interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption. Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[ENTIRe-ID: An Extensive and Diverse Dataset for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20465v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing importance of person reidentification in computer vision has highlighted the need for more extensive and diverse datasets. In response, we introduce the ENTIRe-ID dataset, an extensive collection comprising over 4.45 million images from 37 different cameras in varied environments. This dataset is uniquely designed to tackle the challenges of domain variability and model generalization, areas where existing datasets for person re-identification have fallen short. The ENTIRe-ID dataset stands out for its coverage of a wide array of real-world scenarios, encompassing various lighting conditions, angles of view, and diverse human activities. This design ensures a realistic and robust training platform for ReID models. The ENTIRe-ID dataset is publicly available at https://serdaryildiz.github.io/ENTIRe-ID</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2024 18th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG)</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Dynamic Contrast and Probability Distillation for Unsupervised Person Re-Id](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.14157v1)** | 2022-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised person re-identification (Re-Id) has attracted increasing attention due to its practical application in the read-world video surveillance system. The traditional unsupervised Re-Id are mostly based on the method alternating between clustering and fine-tuning with the classification or metric learning objectives on the grouped clusters. However, since person Re-Id is an open-set problem, the clustering based methods often leave out lots of outlier instances or group the instances into the wrong clusters, thus they can not make full use of the training samples as a whole. To solve these problems, we present the hybrid dynamic cluster contrast and probability distillation algorithm. It formulates the unsupervised Re-Id problem into an unified local-to-global dynamic contrastive learning and self-supervised probability distillation framework. Specifically, the proposed method can make the utmost of the self-supervised signals of all the clustered and un-clustered instances, from both the instances' self-contrastive level and the probability distillation respective, in the memory-based non-parametric manner. Besides, the proposed hybrid local-to-global contrastive learning can take full advantage of the informative and valuable training examples for effective and robust training. Extensive experiment results show that the proposed method achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods, under both the purely unsupervised and unsupervised domain adaptation experiment settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Person Re-ID: Differentiable Graphical Learning and A New Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03845v3)** | 2020-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) benefits greatly from the accurate annotations of existing datasets (e.g., CUHK03 [1] and Market-1501 [2]), which are quite expensive because each image in these datasets has to be assigned with a proper label. In this work, we ease the annotation of Re-ID by replacing the accurate annotation with inaccurate annotation, i.e., we group the images into bags in terms of time and assign a bag-level label for each bag. This greatly reduces the annotation effort and leads to the creation of a large-scale Re-ID benchmark called SYSU-30$k$. The new benchmark contains $30k$ individuals, which is about $20$ times larger than CUHK03 ($1.3k$ individuals) and Market-1501 ($1.5k$ individuals), and $30$ times larger than ImageNet ($1k$ categories). It sums up to 29,606,918 images. Learning a Re-ID model with bag-level annotation is called the weakly supervised Re-ID problem. To solve this problem, we introduce a differentiable graphical model to capture the dependencies from all images in a bag and generate a reliable pseudo label for each person image. The pseudo label is further used to supervise the learning of the Re-ID model. When compared with the fully supervised Re-ID models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SYSU-30$k$ and other datasets. The code, dataset, and pretrained model will be available at \url{https://github.com/wanggrun/SYSU-30k}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2020</p></details> |
| **[Person Re-ID through Unsupervised Hypergraph Rank Selection and Fusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14321v1)** | 2023-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Re-ID has been gaining a lot of attention and nowadays is of fundamental importance in many camera surveillance applications. The task consists of identifying individuals across multiple cameras that have no overlapping views. Most of the approaches require labeled data, which is not always available, given the huge amount of demanded data and the difficulty of manually assigning a class for each individual. Recently, studies have shown that re-ranking methods are capable of achieving significant gains, especially in the absence of labeled data. Besides that, the fusion of feature extractors and multiple-source training is another promising research direction not extensively exploited. We aim to fill this gap through a manifold rank aggregation approach capable of exploiting the complementarity of different person Re-ID rankers. In this work, we perform a completely unsupervised selection and fusion of diverse ranked lists obtained from multiple and diverse feature extractors. Among the contributions, this work proposes a query performance prediction measure that models the relationship among images considering a hypergraph structure and does not require the use of any labeled data. Expressive gains were obtained in four datasets commonly used for person Re-ID. We achieved results competitive to the state-of-the-art in most of the scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-id with Local-enhance and Prototype Dictionary Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.03803v1)** | 2022-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (re-ID) task has been a challenge because, unlike the general domain adaptive tasks, there is no overlap between the classes of source and target domain data in the person re-ID, which leads to a significant domain gap. State-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods train the neural networks using a memory-based contrastive loss. However, performing contrastive learning by treating each unlabeled instance as a class will lead to the problem of class collision, and the updating intensity is inconsistent due to the difference in the number of instances of different categories when updating in the memory bank. To address such problems, we propose Prototype Dictionary Learning for person re-ID which is able to utilize both source domain data and target domain data by one training stage while avoiding the problem of class collision and the problem of updating intensity inconsistency by cluster-level prototype dictionary learning. In order to reduce the interference of domain gap on the model, we propose a local-enhance module to improve the domain adaptation of the model without increasing the number of model parameters. Our experiments on two large datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the prototype dictionary learning. 71.5\% mAP is achieved in the Market-to-Duke task, which is a 2.3\% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptive re-ID methods. It achieves 83.9\% mAP in the Duke-to-Market task, which improves by 4.4\% compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptive re-ID methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Template Initialization for Part-Aware Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11440v1)** | 2022-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing Person Re-identification (Re-ID) approaches depend on feature maps which are either partitioned to localize parts of a person or reduced to create a global representation. While part localization has shown significant success, it uses either naıve position-based partitions or static feature templates. These, however, hypothesize the pre-existence of the parts in a given image or their positions, ignoring the input image-specific information which limits their usability in challenging scenarios such as Re-ID with partial occlusions and partial probe images. In this paper, we introduce a spatial attention-based Dynamic Part Template Initialization module that dynamically generates part-templates using mid-level semantic features at the earlier layers of the backbone. Following a self-attention layer, human part-level features of the backbone are used to extract the templates of diverse human body parts using a simplified cross-attention scheme which will then be used to identify and collate representations of various human parts from semantically rich features, increasing the discriminative ability of the entire model. We further explore adaptive weighting of part descriptors to quantify the absence or occlusion of local attributes and suppress the contribution of the corresponding part descriptors to the matching criteria. Extensive experiments on holistic, occluded, and partial Re-ID task benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed architecture is able to achieve competitive performance. Codes will be included in the supplementary material and will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[HorNet: A Hierarchical Offshoot Recurrent Network for Improving Person Re-ID via Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04915v1)** | 2019-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to recognize a person-of-interest across different cameras with notable appearance variance. Existing research works focused on the capability and robustness of visual representation. In this paper, instead, we propose a novel hierarchical offshoot recurrent network (HorNet) for improving person re-ID via image captioning. Image captions are semantically richer and more consistent than visual attributes, which could significantly alleviate the variance. We use the similarity preserving generative adversarial network (SPGAN) and an image captioner to fulfill domain transfer and language descriptions generation. Then the proposed HorNet can learn the visual and language representation from both the images and captions jointly, and thus enhance the performance of person re-ID. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets with or without image captions, i.e., CUHK03, Market-1501, and Duke-MTMC, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method. Our method can generate and extract meaningful image captions while achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, published in IJCAI19</p></details> |
| **[Following the Clues: Experiments on Person Re-ID using Cross-Modal Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01504v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However, these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians, due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's practical utility.

| **[ESA-ReID: Entropy-Based Semantic Feature Alignment for Person re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04644v1)** | 2020-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-ID) is a challenging task in real-world. Besides the typical application in surveillance system, re-ID also has significant values to improve the recall rate of people identification in content video (TV or Movies). However, the occlusion, shot angle variations and complicated background make it far away from application, especially in content video. In this paper we propose an entropy based semantic feature alignment model, which takes advantages of the detailed information of the human semantic feature. Considering the uncertainty of semantic segmentation, we introduce a semantic alignment with an entropy-based mask which can reduce the negative effects of mask segmentation errors. We construct a new re-ID dataset based on content videos with many cases of occlusion and body part missing, which will be released in future. Extensive studies on both existing datasets and the new dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hazy Re-ID: An Interference Suppression Model For Domain Adaptation Person Re-identification Under Inclement Weather Condition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.11004v1)** | 2021-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a conventional domain adaptation person Re-identification (Re-ID) task, both the training and test images in target domain are collected under the sunny weather. However, in reality, the pedestrians to be retrieved may be obtained under severe weather conditions such as hazy, dusty and snowing, etc. This paper proposes a novel Interference Suppression Model (ISM) to deal with the interference caused by the hazy weather in domain adaptation person Re-ID. A teacherstudent model is used in the ISM to distill the interference information at the feature level by reducing the discrepancy between the clear and the hazy intrinsic similarity matrix. Furthermore, in the distribution level, the extra discriminator is introduced to assist the student model make the interference feature distribution more clear. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the superior performance on two synthetic datasets than the stateof-the-art methods. The related code will be released online https://github.com/pangjian123/ISM-ReID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME2021 as oral</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Centroid Representation Network for Domain Adaptive Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.11689v1)** | 2021-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many approaches tackle the Unsupervised Domain Adaptive person re-identification (UDA re-ID) problem through pseudo-label-based contrastive learning. During training, a uni-centroid representation is obtained by simply averaging all the instance features from a cluster with the same pseudo label. However, a cluster may contain images with different identities (label noises) due to the imperfect clustering results, which makes the uni-centroid representation inappropriate. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Centroid Memory (MCM) to adaptively capture different identity information within the cluster. MCM can effectively alleviate the issue of label noises by selecting proper positive/negative centroids for the query image. Moreover, we further propose two strategies to improve the contrastive learning process. First, we present a Domain-Specific Contrastive Learning (DSCL) mechanism to fully explore intradomain information by comparing samples only from the same domain. Second, we propose Second-Order Nearest Interpolation (SONI) to obtain abundant and informative negative samples. We integrate MCM, DSCL, and SONI into a unified framework named Multi-Centroid Representation Network (MCRN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MCRN over state-of-the-art approaches on multiple UDA re-ID tasks and fully unsupervised re-ID tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2022 |
| **[AG-VPReID.VIR: Bridging Aerial and Ground Platforms for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17995v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837 identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies, and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple evaluation protocols.

| **[ID-aware Quality for Set-based Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09143v1)** | 2019-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Set-based person re-identification (SReID) is a matching problem that aims to verify whether two sets are of the same identity (ID). Existing SReID models typically generate a feature representation per image and aggregate them to represent the set as a single embedding. However, they can easily be perturbed by noises--perceptually/semantically low quality images--which are inevitable due to imperfect tracking/detection systems, or overfit to trivial images. In this work, we present a novel and simple solution to this problem based on ID-aware quality that measures the perceptual and semantic quality of images guided by their ID information. Specifically, we propose an ID-aware Embedding that consists of two key components: (1) Feature learning attention that aims to learn robust image embeddings by focusing on 'medium' hard images. This way it can prevent overfitting to trivial images, and alleviate the influence of outliers. (2) Feature fusion attention is to fuse image embeddings in the set to obtain the set-level embedding. It ignores noisy information and pays more attention to discriminative images to aggregate more discriminative information. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches despite the simplicity of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Set...</summary><p>A Set-based Person Re-identification Baseline: Simple Average Fusion of Global Spatial Representations, without temporal information, without parts/poses/attributes information</p></details> |
| **[Domain Camera Adaptation and Collaborative Multiple Feature Clustering for Unsupervised Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08624v2)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) has drawn much attention due to its open-world scenario settings where limited annotated data is available. Existing supervised methods often fail to generalize well on unseen domains, while the unsupervised methods, mostly lack multi-granularity information and are prone to suffer from confirmation bias. In this paper, we aim at finding better feature representations on the unseen target domain from two aspects, 1) performing unsupervised domain adaptation on the labeled source domain and 2) mining potential similarities on the unlabeled target domain. Besides, a collaborative pseudo re-labeling strategy is proposed to alleviate the influence of confirmation bias. Firstly, a generative adversarial network is utilized to transfer images from the source domain to the target domain. Moreover, person identity preserving and identity mapping losses are introduced to improve the quality of generated images. Secondly, we propose a novel collaborative multiple feature clustering framework (CMFC) to learn the internal data structure of target domain, including global feature and partial feature branches. The global feature branch (GB) employs unsupervised clustering on the global feature of person images while the Partial feature branch (PB) mines similarities within different body regions. Finally, extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show the competitive performance of our method under unsupervised person re-ID settings.</p></details> | ACMMM 2022 |

| **[IDM: An Intermediate Domain Module for Domain Adaptive Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02413v1)** | 2021-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (UDA re-ID) aims at transferring the labeled source domain's knowledge to improve the model's discriminability on the unlabeled target domain. From a novel perspective, we argue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized to tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate intermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we propose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains' representations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden representations using two domain factors. Based on the "shortest geodesic path" definition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path between the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two properties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two properties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce the bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space, and enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim at guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the right distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a regularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being over-fitting to either of the source and target domains. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin in all the common UDA re-ID tasks, and the mAP gain is up to 7.7% on the challenging MSMT17 benchmark.

| **[Structured Domain Adaptation with Online Relation Regularization for Unsupervised Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06650v3)** | 2022-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims at adapting the model trained on a labeled source-domain dataset to an unlabeled target-domain dataset. The task of UDA on open-set person re-identification (re-ID) is even more challenging as the identities (classes) do not have overlap between the two domains. One major research direction was based on domain translation, which, however, has fallen out of favor in recent years due to inferior performance compared to pseudo-label-based methods. We argue that the domain translation has great potential on exploiting the valuable source-domain data but existing methods did not provide proper regularization on the translation process. Specifically, previous methods only focus on maintaining the identities of the translated images while ignoring the inter-sample relations during translation. To tackle the challenges, we propose an end-to-end structured domain adaptation framework with an online relation-consistency regularization term. During training, the person feature encoder is optimized to model inter-sample relations on-the-fly for supervising relation-consistency domain translation, which in turn, improves the encoder with informative translated images. The encoder can be further improved with pseudo labels, where the source-to-target translated images with ground-truth identities and target-domain images with pseudo identities are jointly used for training. In the experiments, our proposed framework is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple UDA tasks of person re-ID. With the synthetic-to-real translated images from our structured domain-translation network, we achieved second place in the Visual Domain Adaptation Challenge (VisDA) in 2020.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Cerberus: Attribute-based person re-identification using semantic IDs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01048v1)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new framework, dubbed Cerberus, for attribute-based person re-identification (reID). Our approach leverages person attribute labels to learn local and global person representations that encode specific traits, such as gender and clothing style. To achieve this, we define semantic IDs (SIDs) by combining attribute labels, and use a semantic guidance loss to align the person representations with the prototypical features of corresponding SIDs, encouraging the representations to encode the relevant semantics. Simultaneously, we enforce the representations of the same person to be embedded closely, enabling recognizing subtle differences in appearance to discriminate persons sharing the same attribute labels. To increase the generalization ability on unseen data, we also propose a regularization method that takes advantage of the relationships between SID prototypes. Our framework performs individual comparisons of local and global person representations between query and gallery images for attribute-based reID. By exploiting the SID prototypes aligned with the corresponding representations, it can also perform person attribute recognition (PAR) and attribute-based person search (APS) without bells and whistles. Experimental results on standard benchmarks on attribute-based person reID, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC, demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

However, in realistic scenarios, such as shop floor operations, such an assumption may not hold and personalized target recognition by the robot in crowded environments is required. To fulfil this requirement, in this work, we propose a person re-identification module based on continual visual adaptation techniques that ensure the robot's seamless cooperation with the appropriate individual even subject to varying visual appearances or partial or complete occlusions. We test the framework singularly using recorded videos in a laboratory environment and an HRI scenario, i.e., a person-following task by a mobile robot. The targets are asked to change their appearance during tracking and to disappear from the camera field of view to test the challenging cases of occlusion and outfit variations. We compare our framework with one of the state-of-the-art Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods and the results show that the CARPE-ID can accurately track each selected target throughout the experiments in all the cases (except two limit cases). At the same time, the s-o-t-a MOT has a mean of 4 tracking errors for each video.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Memorizing Comprehensively to Learn Adaptively: Unsupervised Cross-Domain Person Re-ID with Multi-level Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04123v1)** | 2020-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised cross-domain person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to adapt the information from the labelled source domain to an unlabelled target domain. Due to the lack of supervision in the target domain, it is crucial to identify the underlying similarity-and-dissimilarity relationships among the unlabelled samples in the target domain. In order to use the whole data relationships efficiently in mini-batch training, we apply a series of memory modules to maintain an up-to-date representation of the entire dataset. Unlike the simple exemplar memory in previous works, we propose a novel multi-level memory network (MMN) to discover multi-level complementary information in the target domain, relying on three memory modules, i.e., part-level memory, instance-level memory, and domain-level memory. The proposed memory modules store multi-level representations of the target domain, which capture both the fine-grained differences between images and the global structure for the holistic target domain. The three memory modules complement each other and systematically integrate multi-level supervision from bottom to up. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the multi-level memory modules cooperatively boost the unsupervised cross-domain Re-ID task, and the proposed MMN achieves competitive results.</p></details> |  |

While recent success has been achieved via supervised learning using deep neural networks, such methods have limited widespread adoption due to the need for large-scale, customized data annotation. As such, there has been a recent focus on unsupervised learning approaches to mitigate the data annotation issue; however, current approaches in literature have limited performance compared to supervised learning approaches as well as limited applicability for adoption in new environments. In this paper, we address the aforementioned challenges faced in person re-identification for real-world, practical scenarios by introducing a novel, unsupervised domain adaptation approach for person re-identification. This is accomplished through the introduction of: i) k-reciprocal tracklet Clustering for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (ktCUDA) (for pseudo-label generation on target domain), and ii) Synthesized Heterogeneous RE-id Domain (SHRED) composed of large-scale heterogeneous independent source environments (for improving robustness and adaptability to a wide diversity of target environments). Experimental results across four different image and video benchmark datasets show that the proposed ktCUDA and SHRED approach achieves an average improvement of +5.7 mAP in re-identification performance when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, as well as demonstrate better adaptability to different types of environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Try Harder: Hard Sample Generation and Learning for Clothes-Changing Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11119v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID) tasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation (DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2) Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PRCC and LTCC datasets.

Widespread occlusion significantly impacts the performance of person Re-ID. Occluded person Re-ID refers to a pedestrian matching method that deals with challenges such as pedestrian information loss, noise interference, and perspective misalignment. It has garnered extensive attention from researchers. Over the past few years, several occlusion-solving person Re-ID methods have been proposed, tackling various sub-problems arising from occlusion. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that compare, summarize, and evaluate the potential of occluded person Re-ID methods in detail. In this review, we start by providing a detailed overview of the datasets and evaluation scheme used for occluded person Re-ID. Next, we scientifically classify and analyze existing deep learning-based occluded person Re-ID methods from various perspectives, summarizing them concisely. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic comparison among these methods, identify the state-of-the-art approaches, and present an outlook on the future development of occluded person Re-ID.</p></details> |  |

Although recent deep re-ID methods have achieved great improvement, it is still difficult to optimize deep re-ID model without annotations in training data. To address this problem, this study introduces a novel approach for unsupervised person re-ID by leveraging virtual and real data. Our approach includes two components: virtual person generation and training of deep re-ID model. For virtual person generation, we learn a person generation model and a camera style transfer model using unlabeled real data to generate virtual persons with different poses and camera styles. The virtual data is formed as labeled training data, enabling subsequently training deep re-ID model in supervision. For training of deep re-ID model, we divide it into three steps: 1) pre-training a coarse re-ID model by using virtual data; 2) collaborative filtering based positive pair mining from the real data; and 3) fine-tuning of the coarse re-ID model by leveraging the mined positive pairs and virtual data. The final re-ID model is achieved by iterating between step 2 and step 3 until convergence. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and shows that the state of the art is achieved in unsupervised person re-ID.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The main research goal of person Re-ID is to retrieve persons with the same identity from different cameras. However, traditional person Re-ID methods require manual marking of person targets, which consumes a lot of labor cost. With the widespread application of deep neural networks, many deep learning-based person Re-ID methods have emerged. Therefore, this paper is to facilitate researchers to understand the latest research results and the future trends in the field. Firstly, we summarize the studies of several recently published person Re-ID surveys and complement the latest research methods to systematically classify deep learning-based person Re-ID methods. Secondly, we propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy that classifies current deep learning-based person Re-ID methods into four categories according to metric and representation learning, including methods for deep metric learning, local feature learning, generative adversarial learning and sequence feature learning. Furthermore, we subdivide the above four categories according to their methodologies and motivations, discussing the advantages and limitations of part subcategories. Finally, we discuss some challenges and possible research directions for person Re-ID.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Person Re-Identification: A Systematic Survey of Challenges and Solutions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06057v2)** | 2021-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been a significant research topic in the past decade due to its real-world applications and research significance. While supervised person Re-ID methods achieve superior performance over unsupervised counterparts, they can not scale to large unlabelled datasets and new domains due to the prohibitive labelling cost. Therefore, unsupervised person Re-ID has drawn increasing attention for its potential to address the scalability issue in person Re-ID. Unsupervised person Re-ID is challenging primarily due to lacking identity labels to supervise person feature learning. The corresponding solutions are diverse and complex, with various merits and limitations. Therefore, comprehensive surveys on this topic are essential to summarise challenges and solutions to foster future research. Existing person Re-ID surveys have focused on supervised methods from classifications and applications but lack detailed discussion on how the person Re-ID solutions address the underlying challenges. This survey review recent works on unsupervised person Re-ID from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of highly influential methods considering the four significant challenges in unsupervised person Re-ID: 1) lacking ground-truth identity labels to supervise person feature learning; 2) learning discriminative person features with pseudo-supervision; 3) learning cross-camera invariant person feature, and 4) the domain shift between datasets. We summarise and analyse evaluation results and provide insights on the effectiveness of the solutions. Finally, we discuss open issues and suggest some promising future research directions.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Several academic benchmarks such as Market1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC play important roles to promote the re-id research. To our best knowledge, all the existing benchmarks assume the same person will have the same clothes. While in real-world scenarios, it is very often for a person to change clothes. To address the clothes changing person re-id problem, we construct a novel large-scale re-id benchmark named ClOthes ChAnging Person Set (COCAS), which provides multiple images of the same identity with different clothes. COCAS totally contains 62,382 body images from 5,266 persons. Based on COCAS, we introduce a new person re-id setting for clothes changing problem, where the query includes both a clothes template and a person image taking another clothes. Moreover, we propose a two-branch network named Biometric-Clothes Network (BC-Net) which can effectively integrate biometric and clothes feature for re-id under our setting. Experiments show that it is feasible for clothes changing re-id with clothes templates.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2020 |
| **[Making Person Search Enjoy the Merits of Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10536v2)** | 2021-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person search is an extended task of person re-identification (Re-ID). However, most existing one-step person search works have not studied how to employ existing advanced Re-ID models to boost the one-step person search performance due to the integration of person detection and Re-ID. To address this issue, we propose a faster and stronger one-step person search framework, the Teacher-guided Disentangling Networks (TDN), to make the one-step person search enjoy the merits of the existing Re-ID researches. The proposed TDN can significantly boost the person search performance by transferring the advanced person Re-ID knowledge to the person search model. In the proposed TDN, for better knowledge transfer from the Re-ID teacher model to the one-step person search model, we design a strong one-step person search base framework by partially disentangling the two subtasks. Besides, we propose a Knowledge Transfer Bridge module to bridge the scale gap caused by different input formats between the Re-ID model and one-step person search model. During testing, we further propose the Ranking with Context Persons strategy to exploit the context information in panoramic images for better retrieval. Experiments on two public person search datasets demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

With the promotion of deep learning technology and the increasing demand for intelligent video surveillance, the frequent occlusion in real-world applications has made occluded person Re-ID draw considerable interest from researchers. A large number of occluded person Re-ID methods have been proposed while there are few surveys that focus on occlusion. To fill this gap and help boost future research, this paper provides a systematic survey of occluded person Re-ID. Through an in-depth analysis of the occlusion in person Re-ID, most existing methods are found to only consider part of the problems brought by occlusion. Therefore, we review occlusion-related person Re-ID methods from the perspective of issues and solutions. We summarize four issues caused by occlusion in person Re-ID, i.e., position misalignment, scale misalignment, noisy information, and missing information. The occlusion-related methods addressing different issues are then categorized and introduced accordingly. After that, we summarize and compare the performance of recent occluded person Re-ID methods on four popular datasets: Partial-ReID, Partial-iLIDS, Occluded-ReID, and Occluded-DukeMTMC.

We propose a method to emphasize texture in 3D person re-ID models by incorporating UVTexture mapping, which better differentiates human subjects. Our approach uniquely combines UVTexture and its heatmaps with 3D models to visualize and explain the person re-ID process. In particular, the visualization and explanation are achieved through activation maps and attribute-based attention maps, which highlight the important regions and features contributing to the person re-ID decision. Our contributions include: (1) a novel technique for emphasizing texture in 3D models using UVTexture processing, (2) an innovative method for explicating person re-ID matches through a combination of 3D models and UVTexture mapping, and (3) achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D person re-ID.

| **[Person Re-identification by Contour Sketch under Moderate Clothing Change](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.02295v1)** | 2020-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-id), the process of matching pedestrian images across different camera views, is an important task in visual surveillance. Substantial development of re-id has recently been observed, and the majority of existing models are largely dependent on color appearance and assume that pedestrians do not change their clothes across camera views. This limitation, however, can be an issue for re-id when tracking a person at different places and at different time if that person (e.g., a criminal suspect) changes his/her clothes, causing most existing methods to fail, since they are heavily relying on color appearance and thus they are inclined to match a person to another person wearing similar clothes. In this work, we call the person re-id under clothing change the "cross-clothes person re-id". In particular, we consider the case when a person only changes his clothes moderately as a first attempt at solving this problem based on visible light images; that is we assume that a person wears clothes of a similar thickness, and thus the shape of a person would not change significantly when the weather does not change substantially within a short period of time. We perform cross-clothes person re-id based on a contour sketch of person image to take advantage of the shape of the human body instead of color information for extracting features that are robust to moderate clothing change. Due to the lack of a large-scale dataset for cross-clothes person re-id, we contribute a new dataset that consists of 33698 images from 221 identities. Our experiments illustrate the challenges of cross-clothes person re-id and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | To appear in TPAMI |
| **[Unsupervised Long-Term Person Re-Identification with Clothes Change](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03087v3)** | 2024-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) with clothes change, a new challenging problem with more practical usability and scalability to real-world deployment. Most existing re-id methods artificially assume the clothes of every single person to be stationary across space and time. This condition is mostly valid for short-term re-id scenarios since an average person would often change the clothes even within a single day. To alleviate this assumption, several recent works have introduced the clothes change facet to re-id, with a focus on supervised learning person identity discriminative representation with invariance to clothes changes. Taking a step further towards this long-term re-id direction, we further eliminate the requirement of person identity labels, as they are significantly more expensive and more tedious to annotate in comparison to short-term person re-id datasets. Compared to conventional unsupervised short-term re-id, this new problem is drastically more challenging as different people may have similar clothes whilst the same person can wear multiple suites of clothes over different locations and times with very distinct appearance. To overcome such obstacles, we introduce a novel Curriculum Person Clustering (CPC) method that can adaptively regulate the unsupervised clustering criterion according to the clustering confidence. Experiments on three long-term person re-id datasets show that our CPC outperforms SOTA unsupervised re-id methods and even closely matches the supervised re-id models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the wide range of applicable areas such as security surveillance, video retrieval, person tracking, and social media analytics, there is a notable absence of comprehensive reviews dedicated to summarizing the text-based person Re-ID from a technical perspective. To address this gap, we propose to introduce a taxonomy spanning Evaluation, Strategy, Architecture, and Optimization dimensions, providing a comprehensive survey of the text-based person Re-ID task. We start by laying the groundwork for text-based person Re-ID, elucidating fundamental concepts related to attribute/natural language-based identification. Then a thorough examination of existing benchmark datasets and metrics is presented. Subsequently, we further delve into prevalent feature extraction strategies employed in text-based person Re-ID research, followed by a concise summary of common network architectures within the domain. Prevalent loss functions utilized for model optimization and modality alignment in text-based person Re-ID are also scrutinized. To conclude, we offer a concise summary of our findings, pinpointing challenges in text-based person Re-ID. In response to these challenges, we outline potential avenues for future open-set text-based person Re-ID and present a baseline architecture for text-based pedestrian image generation-guided re-identification(TBPGR).</p></details> |  |

This is significantly breached in practice when person bounding boxes must be detected automatically given a very large number of images and/or videos processed. Compared to carefully cropped manually, auto-detected bounding boxes are far less accurate with random amount of background clutter which can degrade notably person re-id matching accuracy. In this work, we develop a joint learning deep model that optimises person re-id attention selection within any auto-detected person bounding boxes by reinforcement learning of background clutter minimisation subject to re-id label pairwise constraints. Specifically, we formulate a novel unified re-id architecture called Identity DiscriminativE Attention reinforcement Learning (IDEAL) to accurately select re-id attention in auto-detected bounding boxes for optimising re-id performance. Our model can improve re-id accuracy comparable to that from exhaustive human manual cropping of bounding boxes with additional advantages from identity discriminative attention selection that specially benefits re-id tasks beyond human knowledge. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the re-id advantages of the proposed IDEAL model over a wide range of state-of-the-art re-id methods on two auto-detected re-id benchmarks CUHK03 and Market-1501.</p></details> | <details><summary>Addit...</summary><p>Additional revision is needed</p></details> |

Such a paradigm suffers the scalability issue since in real-world Re-ID application, it is difficult to exhaustively label abundant identities over multiple disjoint camera views. To this end, we propose a progressive deep learning method for unsupervised person Re-ID in the wild by Tracklet Association with Spatio-Temporal Regularization (TASTR). In our approach, we first collect tracklet data within each camera by automatic person detection and tracking. Then, an initial Re-ID model is trained based on within-camera triplet construction for person representation learning. After that, based on the person visual feature and spatio-temporal constraint, we associate cross-camera tracklets to generate cross-camera triplets and update the Re-ID model. Lastly, with the refined Re-ID model, better visual feature of person can be extracted, which further promote the association of cross-camera tracklets. The last two steps are iterated multiple times to progressively upgrade the Re-ID model.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

PSTR comprises a person search-specialized (PSS) module that contains a detection encoder-decoder for person detection along with a discriminative re-id decoder for person re-id. The discriminative re-id decoder utilizes a multi-level supervision scheme with a shared decoder for discriminative re-id feature learning and also comprises a part attention block to encode relationship between different parts of a person. We further introduce a simple multi-scale scheme to support re-id across person instances at different scales. PSTR jointly achieves the diverse objectives of object-level recognition (detection) and instance-level matching (re-id). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an end-to-end one-step transformer-based person search framework. Experiments are performed on two popular benchmarks: CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Our extensive ablations reveal the merits of the proposed contributions. Further, the proposed PSTR sets a new state-of-the-art on both benchmarks. On the challenging PRW benchmark, PSTR achieves a mean average precision (mAP) score of 56.5%.

Nonetheless, pose information is very helpful to disentangle useful feature information from background or occlusion noise. Especially real-world scenarios, such as surveillance, contain a lot of occlusions in human crowds or by obstacles. On the other hand, video-based person re-ID can benefit other tasks such as multi-person pose tracking in terms of robust feature matching. For that reason, we present PoseTrackReID, a large-scale dataset for multi-person pose tracking and video-based person re-ID. With PoseTrackReID, we want to bridge the gap between person re-ID and multi-person pose tracking. Additionally, this dataset provides a good benchmark for current state-of-the-art methods on multi-frame person re-ID.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Pre-training for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03753v2)** | 2021-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a large scale unlabeled person re-identification (Re-ID) dataset "LUPerson" and make the first attempt of performing unsupervised pre-training for improving the generalization ability of the learned person Re-ID feature representation. This is to address the problem that all existing person Re-ID datasets are all of limited scale due to the costly effort required for data annotation. Previous research tries to leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate the shortage of person Re-ID data but suffers from the large domain gap between ImageNet and person Re-ID data. LUPerson is an unlabeled dataset of 4M images of over 200K identities, which is 30X larger than the largest existing Re-ID dataset. It also covers a much diverse range of capturing environments (eg, camera settings, scenes, etc.). Based on this dataset, we systematically study the key factors for learning Re-ID features from two perspectives: data augmentation and contrastive loss. Unsupervised pre-training performed on this large-scale dataset effectively leads to a generic Re-ID feature that can benefit all existing person Re-ID methods. Using our pre-trained model in some basic frameworks, our methods achieve state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles on four widely used Re-ID datasets: CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17. Our results also show that the performance improvement is more significant on small-scale target datasets or under few-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at CVPR 2021</p></details> |

Due to its vital role in security based applications, person re-identification lies at the heart of research relevant to tracking robberies, preventing terrorist attacks and other security critical events. While the last decade has seen tremendous growth in re-id approaches, very little review literature exists to comprehend and summarize this progress. This review deals with the latest state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches for person re-identification. While the few existing re-id review works have analysed re-id techniques from a singular aspect, this review evaluates numerous re-id techniques from multiple deep learning aspects such as deep architecture types, common Re-Id challenges (variation in pose, lightning, view, scale, partial or complete occlusion, background clutter), multi-modal Re-Id, cross-domain Re-Id challenges, metric learning approaches and video Re-Id contributions. This review also includes several re-id benchmarks collected over the years, describing their characteristics, specifications and top re-id results obtained on them. The inclusion of the latest deep re-id works makes this a significant contribution to the re-id literature. Lastly, the conclusion and future directions are included.</p></details> | 34 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Deep Hybrid Similarity Learning for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04858v2)** | 2017-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) aims to match person images captured from two non-overlapping cameras. In this paper, a deep hybrid similarity learning (DHSL) method for person Re-ID based on a convolution neural network (CNN) is proposed. In our approach, a CNN learning feature pair for the input image pair is simultaneously extracted. Then, both the element-wise absolute difference and multiplication of the CNN learning feature pair are calculated. Finally, a hybrid similarity function is designed to measure the similarity between the feature pair, which is realized by learning a group of weight coefficients to project the element-wise absolute difference and multiplication into a similarity score. Consequently, the proposed DHSL method is able to reasonably assign parameters of feature learning and metric learning in a CNN so that the performance of person Re-ID is improved. Experiments on three challenging person Re-ID databases, QMUL GRID, VIPeR and CUHK03, illustrate that the proposed DHSL method is superior to multiple state-of-the-art person Re-ID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, fixed typo errors in Fig.8</p></details> |

Due to varying distances between cameras and persons of interest, resolution mismatch can be expected, which would degrade re-ID performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel generative adversarial network to address cross-resolution person re-ID, allowing query images with varying resolutions. By advancing adversarial learning techniques, our proposed model learns resolution-invariant image representations while being able to recover the missing details in low-resolution input images. The resulting features can be jointly applied for improving re-ID performance due to preserving resolution invariance and recovering re-ID oriented discriminative details. Extensive experimental results on five standard person re-ID benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method and the superiority over the state-of-the-art approaches, especially when the input resolutions are not seen during training. Furthermore, the experimental results on two vehicle re-ID benchmarks also confirm the generalization of our model on cross-resolution visual tasks. The extensions of semi-supervised settings further support the use of our proposed approach to real-world scenarios and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI). 17 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1908.06052</p></details> |
| **[Test-time Similarity Modification for Person Re-identification toward Temporal Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14114v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-id), which aims to retrieve images of the same person in a given image from a database, is one of the most practical image recognition applications. In the real world, however, the environments that the images are taken from change over time. This causes a distribution shift between training and testing and degrades the performance of re-id. To maintain re-id performance, models should continue adapting to the test environment's temporal changes. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which aims to adapt models to the test environment with only unlabeled test data, is a promising way to handle this problem because TTA can adapt models instantly in the test environment. However, the previous TTA methods are designed for classification and cannot be directly applied to re-id. This is because the set of people's identities in the dataset differs between training and testing in re-id, whereas the set of classes is fixed in the current TTA methods designed for classification. To improve re-id performance in changing test environments, we propose TEst-time similarity Modification for Person re-identification (TEMP), a novel TTA method for re-id. TEMP is the first fully TTA method for re-id, which does not require any modification to pre-training. Inspired by TTA methods that refine the prediction uncertainty in classification, we aim to refine the uncertainty in re-id. However, the uncertainty cannot be computed in the same way as classification in re-id since it is an open-set task, which does not share person labels between training and testing. Hence, we propose re-id entropy, an alternative uncertainty measure for re-id computed based on the similarity between the feature vectors. Experiments show that the re-id entropy can measure the uncertainty on re-id and TEMP improves the performance of re-id in online settings where the distribution changes over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN2024</p></details> |
| **[Sequential Transformer for End-to-End Person Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04323v2)** | 2022-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Search aims to simultaneously localize and recognize a target person from realistic and uncropped gallery images. One major challenge of person search comes from the contradictory goals of the two sub-tasks, i.e., person detection focuses on finding the commonness of all persons so as to distinguish persons from the background, while person re-identification (re-ID) focuses on the differences among different persons. In this paper, we propose a novel Sequential Transformer (SeqTR) for end-to-end person search to deal with this challenge. Our SeqTR contains a detection transformer and a novel re-ID transformer that sequentially addresses detection and re-ID tasks. The re-ID transformer comprises the self-attention layer that utilizes contextual information and the cross-attention layer that learns local fine-grained discriminative features of the human body. Moreover, the re-ID transformer is shared and supervised by multi-scale features to improve the robustness of learned person representations. Extensive experiments on two widely-used person search benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, show that our proposed SeqTR not only outperforms all existing person search methods with a 59.3% mAP on PRW but also achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results with an mAP of 94.8% on CUHK-SYSU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Coarse Granularity Part-level Features with Supervised Global-level Features for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07675v1)** | 2020-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Holistic person re-identification (Re-ID) and partial person re-identification have achieved great progress respectively in recent years. However, scenarios in reality often include both holistic and partial pedestrian images, which makes single holistic or partial person Re-ID hard to work. In this paper, we propose a robust coarse granularity part-level person Re-ID network (CGPN), which not only extracts robust regional level body features, but also integrates supervised global features for both holistic and partial person images. CGPN gains two-fold benefit toward higher accuracy for person Re-ID. On one hand, CGPN learns to extract effective body part features for both holistic and partial person images. On the other hand, compared with extracting global features directly by backbone network, CGPN learns to extract more accurate global features with a supervision strategy. The single model trained on three Re-ID datasets including Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 achieves state-of-the-art performances and outperforms any existing approaches. Especially on CUHK03, which is the most challenging dataset for person Re-ID, in single query mode, we obtain a top result of Rank-1/mAP=87.1\%/83.6\% with this method without re-ranking, outperforming the current best method by +7.0\%/+6.7\%.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end Part-Aware Transformer (PAT) for occluded person Re-ID through diverse part discovery via a transformer encoderdecoder architecture, including a pixel context based transformer encoder and a part prototype based transformer decoder. The proposed PAT model enjoys several merits. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit the transformer encoder-decoder architecture for occluded person Re-ID in a unified deep model. Second, to learn part prototypes well with only identity labels, we design two effective mechanisms including part diversity and part discriminability. Consequently, we can achieve diverse part discovery for occluded person Re-ID in a weakly supervised manner. Extensive experimental results on six challenging benchmarks for three tasks (occluded, partial and holistic Re-ID) demonstrate that our proposed PAT performs favorably against stat-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2021</p></details> |

| **[Semi-Supervised Domain Generalizable Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05045v2)** | 2021-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing person re-identification (re-id) methods are stuck when deployed to a new unseen scenario despite the success in cross-camera person matching. Recent efforts have been substantially devoted to domain adaptive person re-id where extensive unlabeled data in the new scenario are utilized in a transductive learning manner. However, for each scenario, it is required to first collect enough data and then train such a domain adaptive re-id model, thus restricting their practical application. Instead, we aim to explore multiple labeled datasets to learn generalized domain-invariant representations for person re-id, which is expected universally effective for each new-coming re-id scenario. To pursue practicability in real-world systems, we collect all the person re-id datasets (20 datasets) in this field and select the three most frequently used datasets (i.e., Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) as unseen target domains. In addition, we develop DataHunter that collects over 300K+ weak annotated images named YouTube-Human from YouTube street-view videos, which joins 17 remaining full labeled datasets to form multiple source domains. On such a large and challenging benchmark called FastHuman (~440K+ labeled images), we further propose a simple yet effective Semi-Supervised Knowledge Distillation (SSKD) framework. SSKD effectively exploits the weakly annotated data by assigning soft pseudo labels to YouTube-Human to improve models' generalization ability. Experiments on several protocols verify the effectiveness of the proposed SSKD framework on domain generalizable person re-id, which is even comparable to supervised learning on the target domains. Lastly, but most importantly, we hope the proposed benchmark FastHuman could bring the next development of domain generalizable person re-id algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Driven Deep Models for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08709v1)** | 2018-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-id) is the task of recognizing and matching persons at different locations recorded by cameras with non-overlapping views. One of the main challenges of re-id is the large variance in person poses and camera angles since neither of them can be influenced by the re-id system. In this work, an effective approach to integrate coarse camera view information as well as fine-grained pose information into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for learning discriminative re-id embeddings is introduced. In most recent work pose information is either explicitly modeled within the re-id system or explicitly used for pre-processing, for example by pose-normalizing person images. In contrast, the proposed approach shows that a direct use of camera view as well as the detected body joint locations into a standard CNN can be used to significantly improve the robustness of learned re-id embeddings. On four challenging surveillance and video re-id datasets significant improvements over the current state of the art have been achieved. Furthermore, a novel reordering of the MARS dataset, called X-MARS is introduced to allow cross-validation of models trained for single-image re-id on tracklet data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Modal-Invariant and Temporal-Memory for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.02450v1)** | 2022-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thanks for the cross-modal retrieval techniques, visible-infrared (RGB-IR) person re-identification (Re-ID) is achieved by projecting them into a common space, allowing person Re-ID in 24-hour surveillance systems. However, with respect to the probe-to-gallery, almost all existing RGB-IR based cross-modal person Re-ID methods focus on image-to-image matching, while the video-to-video matching which contains much richer spatial- and temporal-information remains under-explored. In this paper, we primarily study the video-based cross-modal person Re-ID method. To achieve this task, a video-based RGB-IR dataset is constructed, in which 927 valid identities with 463,259 frames and 21,863 tracklets captured by 12 RGB/IR cameras are collected. Based on our constructed dataset, we prove that with the increase of frames in a tracklet, the performance does meet more enhancement, demonstrating the significance of video-to-video matching in RGB-IR person Re-ID. Additionally, a novel method is further proposed, which not only projects two modalities to a modal-invariant subspace, but also extracts the temporal-memory for motion-invariant. Thanks to these two strategies, much better results are achieved on our video-based cross-modal person Re-ID. The code and dataset are released at: https://github.com/VCMproject233/MITML.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Person Re-identification: Algorithms and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.15076v6)** | 2021-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-ID) in the scenario with large spatial and temporal spans has not been fully explored. This is partially because that, existing benchmark datasets were mainly collected with limited spatial and temporal ranges, e.g., using videos recorded in a few days by cameras in a specific region of the campus. Such limited spatial and temporal ranges make it hard to simulate the difficulties of person re-ID in real scenarios. In this work, we contribute a novel Large-scale Spatio-Temporal LaST person re-ID dataset, including 10,862 identities with more than 228k images. Compared with existing datasets, LaST presents more challenging and high-diversity re-ID settings, and significantly larger spatial and temporal ranges. For instance, each person can appear in different cities or countries, and in various time slots from daytime to night, and in different seasons from spring to winter. To our best knowledge, LaST is a novel person re-ID dataset with the largest spatio-temporal ranges. Based on LaST, we verified its challenge by conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of 14 re-ID algorithms. We further propose an easy-to-implement baseline that works well on such challenging re-ID setting. We also verified that models pre-trained on LaST can generalize well on existing datasets with short-term and cloth-changing scenarios. We expect LaST to inspire future works toward more realistic and challenging re-ID tasks.

With the advancement of deep neural networks and increasing demand of intelligent video surveillance, it has gained significantly increased interest in the computer vision community. By dissecting the involved components in developing a person Re-ID system, we categorize it into the closed-world and open-world settings. The widely studied closed-world setting is usually applied under various research-oriented assumptions, and has achieved inspiring success using deep learning techniques on a number of datasets. We first conduct a comprehensive overview with in-depth analysis for closed-world person Re-ID from three different perspectives, including deep feature representation learning, deep metric learning and ranking optimization. With the performance saturation under closed-world setting, the research focus for person Re-ID has recently shifted to the open-world setting, facing more challenging issues. This setting is closer to practical applications under specific scenarios. We summarize the open-world Re-ID in terms of five different aspects. By analyzing the advantages of existing methods, we design a powerful AGW baseline, achieving state-of-the-art or at least comparable performance on twelve datasets for FOUR different Re-ID tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric (mINP) for person Re-ID, indicating the cost for finding all the correct matches, which provides an additional criteria to evaluate the Re-ID system for real applications. Finally, some important yet under-investigated open issues are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures. Accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |

With the increase of wearable video recording devices, egocentric data becomes readily available, and person re-identification has the potential to benefit greatly from this. However, there is a significant lack of large scale structured egocentric datasets for person re-identification, due to the poor video quality and lack of individuals in most of the recorded content. Although a lot of research has been done in person re-identification based on fixed surveillance cameras, these do not directly benefit egocentric re-ID. Machine learning models trained on the publicly available large scale re-ID datasets cannot be applied to egocentric re-ID due to the dataset bias problem. The proposed algorithm makes use of neural style transfer (NST) that incorporates a variant of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to utilize the benefits of both fixed camera vision and first-person vision. NST generates images having features from both egocentric datasets and fixed camera datasets, that are fed through a VGG-16 network trained on a fixed-camera dataset for feature extraction. These extracted features are then used to re-identify individuals. The fixed camera dataset Market-1501 and the first-person dataset EGO Re-ID are applied for this work and the results are on par with the present re-identification models in the egocentric domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, In Proceedings of the Fifth IAPR International Conference on Computer Vision & Image Processing (CVIP), 2020</p></details> |
| **[Synthesizing Efficient Data with Diffusion Models for Person Re-Identification Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06045v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing person re-identification (Re-ID) methods principally deploy the ImageNet-1K dataset for model initialization, which inevitably results in sub-optimal situations due to the large domain gap. One of the key challenges is that building large-scale person Re-ID datasets is time-consuming. Some previous efforts address this problem by collecting person images from the internet e.g., LUPerson, but it struggles to learn from unlabeled, uncontrollable, and noisy data. In this paper, we present a novel paradigm Diffusion-ReID to efficiently augment and generate diverse images based on known identities without requiring any cost of data collection and annotation. Technically, this paradigm unfolds in two stages: generation and filtering. During the generation stage, we propose Language Prompts Enhancement (LPE) to ensure the ID consistency between the input image sequence and the generated images. In the diffusion process, we propose a Diversity Injection (DI) module to increase attribute diversity. In order to make the generated data have higher quality, we apply a Re-ID confidence threshold filter to further remove the low-quality images. Benefiting from our proposed paradigm, we first create a new large-scale person Re-ID dataset Diff-Person, which consists of over 777K images from 5,183 identities. Next, we build a stronger person Re-ID backbone pre-trained on our Diff-Person. Extensive experiments are conducted on four person Re-ID benchmarks in six widely used settings. Compared with other pre-training and self-supervised competitors, our approach shows significant superiority.</p></details> |  |

The CBDB-Net contains two novel designs: the Consecutive Batch DropBlock Module (CBDBM) and the Elastic Loss (EL). In the Consecutive Batch DropBlock Module (CBDBM), we firstly conduct uniform partition on the feature maps. And then, we independently and continuously drop each patch from top to bottom on the feature maps, which can output multiple incomplete feature maps. In the training stage, these multiple incomplete features can better encourage the Re-ID model to capture the robust person descriptor for the Re-ID task. In the Elastic Loss (EL), we design a novel weight control item to help the Re-ID model adaptively balance hard sample pairs and easy sample pairs in the whole training process. Through an extensive set of ablation studies, we verify that the Consecutive Batch DropBlock Module (CBDBM) and the Elastic Loss (EL) each contribute to the performance boosts of CBDB-Net. We demonstrate that our CBDB-Net can achieve the competitive performance on the three standard person Re-ID datasets (the Market-1501, the DukeMTMC-Re-ID, and the CUHK03 dataset), three occluded Person Re-ID datasets (the Occluded DukeMTMC, the Partial-REID, and the Partial iLIDS dataset), and a general image retrieval dataset (In-Shop Clothes Retrieval dataset).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Acceped by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (TCSVT)</p></details> |

Traditional person Re-ID mainly relies on optical camera-based systems, which incur several limitations due to the changes in the appearance of people, occlusions, and human poses. In this work, we propose a WiFi vision-based system, 3D-ID, for person Re-ID in 3D space. Our system leverages the advances of WiFi and deep learning to help WiFi devices see, identify, and recognize people. In particular, we leverage multiple antennas on next-generation WiFi devices and 2D AoA estimation of the signal reflections to enable WiFi to visualize a person in the physical environment. We then leverage deep learning to digitize the visualization of the person into 3D body representation and extract both the static body shape and dynamic walking patterns for person Re-ID. Our evaluation results under various indoor environments show that the 3D-ID system achieves an overall rank-1 accuracy of 85.3%. Results also show that our system is resistant to various attacks. The proposed 3D-ID is thus very promising as it could augment or complement camera-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, USENIX Security '23</p></details> |

Given a set of sparse and learnable proposals, LEAPS employs a dynamic person search head to directly perform person detection and corresponding re-id feature generation without non-maximum suppression post-processing. The dynamic person search head comprises a detection head and a novel flexible re-id head. Our flexible re-id head first employs a dynamic region-of-interest (RoI) operation to extract discriminative RoI features of the proposals. Then, it generates re-id features using a plain and a hierarchical interaction re-id module. To better guide discriminative re-id feature learning, we introduce a diverse re-id sample matching strategy, instead of bipartite matching in detection head. Comprehensive experiments reveal the benefit of the proposed LEAPS, achieving a favorable performance on two public person search benchmarks: CUHK-SYSU and PRW. When using the same ResNet50 backbone, our LEAPS obtains a mAP score of 55.0%, outperforming the best reported results in literature by 1.7%, while achieving around a two-fold speedup on the challenging PRW dataset. Our source code and models will be released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Adversarial Open-World Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10482v3)** | 2018-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a typical real-world application of re-id, a watch-list (gallery set) of a handful of target people (e.g. suspects) to track around a large volume of non-target people are demanded across camera views, and this is called the open-world person re-id. Different from conventional (closed-world) person re-id, a large portion of probe samples are not from target people in the open-world setting. And, it always happens that a non-target person would look similar to a target one and therefore would seriously challenge a re-id system. In this work, we introduce a deep open-world group-based person re-id model based on adversarial learning to alleviate the attack problem caused by similar non-target people. The main idea is learning to attack feature extractor on the target people by using GAN to generate very target-like images (imposters), and in the meantime the model will make the feature extractor learn to tolerate the attack by discriminative learning so as to realize group-based verification. The framework we proposed is called the adversarial open-world person re-identification, and this is realized by our Adversarial PersonNet (APN) that jointly learns a generator, a person discriminator, a target discriminator and a feature extractor, where the feature extractor and target discriminator share the same weights so as to makes the feature extractor learn to tolerate the attack by imposters for better group-based verification. While open-world person re-id is challenging, we show for the first time that the adversarial-based approach helps stabilize person re-id system under imposter attack more effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, Accepted by European Conference on Computer Vision 2018</p></details> |

It aims at spotting a person of interest in other cameras. In the early days, hand-crafted algorithms and small-scale evaluation were predominantly reported. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large-scale datasets and deep learning systems which make use of large data volumes. Considering different tasks, we classify most current re-ID methods into two classes, i.e., image-based and video-based; in both tasks, hand-crafted and deep learning systems will be reviewed. Moreover, two new re-ID tasks which are much closer to real-world applications are described and discussed, i.e., end-to-end re-ID and fast re-ID in very large galleries. This paper: 1) introduces the history of person re-ID and its relationship with image classification and instance retrieval; 2) surveys a broad selection of the hand-crafted systems and the large-scale methods in both image- and video-based re-ID; 3) describes critical future directions in end-to-end re-ID and fast retrieval in large galleries; and 4) finally briefs some important yet under-developed issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 tables, 10 images</p></details> |
| **[GreyReID: A Two-stream Deep Framework with RGB-grey Information for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05142v2)** | 2020-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we observe that most false positive images (i.e., different identities with query images) in the top ranking list usually have the similar color information with the query image in person re-identification (Re-ID). Meanwhile, when we use the greyscale images generated from RGB images to conduct the person Re-ID task, some hard query images can obtain better performance compared with using RGB images. Therefore, RGB and greyscale images seem to be complementary to each other for person Re-ID. In this paper, we aim to utilize both RGB and greyscale images to improve the person Re-ID performance. To this end, we propose a novel two-stream deep neural network with RGB-grey information, which can effectively fuse RGB and greyscale feature representations to enhance the generalization ability of Re-ID. Firstly, we convert RGB images to greyscale images in each training batch. Based on these RGB and greyscale images, we train the RGB and greyscale branches, respectively. Secondly, to build up connections between RGB and greyscale branches, we merge the RGB and greyscale branches into a new joint branch. Finally, we concatenate the features of all three branches as the final feature representation for Re-ID. Moreover, in the training process, we adopt the joint learning scheme to simultaneously train each branch by the independent loss function, which can enhance the generalization ability of each branch. Besides, a global loss function is utilized to further fine-tune the final concatenated feature. The extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets fully show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art person Re-ID methods. Furthermore, using greyscale images can indeed improve the person Re-ID performance.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM TOMM |
| **[Improving Person Re-identification by Attribute and Identity Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.07220v3)** | 2019-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-ID) and attribute recognition share a common target at learning pedestrian descriptions. Their difference consists in the granularity. Most existing re-ID methods only take identity labels of pedestrians into consideration. However, we find the attributes, containing detailed local descriptions, are beneficial in allowing the re-ID model to learn more discriminative feature representations. In this paper, based on the complementarity of attribute labels and ID labels, we propose an attribute-person recognition (APR) network, a multi-task network which learns a re-ID embedding and at the same time predicts pedestrian attributes. We manually annotate attribute labels for two large-scale re-ID datasets, and systematically investigate how person re-ID and attribute recognition benefit from each other. In addition, we re-weight the attribute predictions considering the dependencies and correlations among the attributes. The experimental results on two large-scale re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that by learning a more discriminative representation, APR achieves competitive re-ID performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We use APR to speed up the retrieval process by ten times with a minor accuracy drop of 2.92% on Market-1501. Besides, we also apply APR on the attribute recognition task and demonstrate improvement over the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Pattern Recognition (PR)</p></details> |
| **[Harmonious Attention Network for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08122v1)** | 2018-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing person re-identification (re-id) methods either assume the availability of well-aligned person bounding box images as model input or rely on constrained attention selection mechanisms to calibrate misaligned images. They are therefore sub-optimal for re-id matching in arbitrarily aligned person images potentially with large human pose variations and unconstrained auto-detection errors. In this work, we show the advantages of jointly learning attention selection and feature representation in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by maximising the complementary information of different levels of visual attention subject to re-id discriminative learning constraints. Specifically, we formulate a novel Harmonious Attention CNN (HA-CNN) model for joint learning of soft pixel attention and hard regional attention along with simultaneous optimisation of feature representations, dedicated to optimise person re-id in uncontrolled (misaligned) images. Extensive comparative evaluations validate the superiority of this new HA-CNN model for person re-id over a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods on three large-scale benchmarks including CUHK03, Market-1501, and DukeMTMC-ReID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2018</p></details> |

Recently, attributes have been demonstrated beneficially in guiding for learning more discriminative feature representations for Re-ID. As attributes normally co-occur in person images, it is desirable to model the attribute dependencies to improve the attribute prediction and thus Re-ID results. In this paper, we propose to model these attribute dependencies via a novel attribute knowledge graph (AttKG), and propose a novel Attribute Knowledge Graph Convolutional Network (AttKGCN) to solve Re-ID problem. AttKGCN integrates both attribute prediction and Re-ID learning together in a unified end-to-end framework which can boost their performances, respectively. AttKGCN first builds a directed attribute KG whose nodes denote attributes and edges encode the co-occurrence relationships of different attributes. Then, AttKGCN learns a set of inter-dependent attribute classifiers which are combined with person visual descriptors for attribute prediction. Finally, AttKGCN integrates attribute description and deeply visual representation together to construct a more discriminative feature representation for Re-ID task. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AttKGCN on attribute prediction and Re-ID tasks.</p></details> |  |

Since query images in real-world scenarios might suffer from resolution loss, how to solve the resolution mismatch problem during person re-ID becomes a practical problem. Instead of applying separate image super-resolution models, we propose a novel network architecture of Resolution Adaptation and re-Identification Network (RAIN) to solve cross-resolution person re-ID. Advancing the strategy of adversarial learning, we aim at extracting resolution-invariant representations for re-ID, while the proposed model is learned in an end-to-end training fashion. Our experiments confirm that the use of our model can recognize low-resolution query images, even if the resolution is not seen during training. Moreover, the extension of our model for semi-supervised re-ID further confirms the scalability of our proposed method for real-world scenarios and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2019 (Oral)</p></details> |

Learning robust and discriminative features with unlabeled data is of central importance to Re-ID. Recently, more attention has been paid to unsupervised Re-ID algorithms based on clustered pseudo-label. However, the previous approaches did not fully exploit information of hard samples, simply using cluster centroid or all instances for contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose a Hard-sample Guided Hybrid Contrast Learning (HHCL) approach combining cluster-level loss with instance-level loss for unsupervised person Re-ID. Our approach applies cluster centroid contrastive loss to ensure that the network is updated in a more stable way. Meanwhile, introduction of a hard instance contrastive loss further mines the discriminative information. Extensive experiments on two popular large-scale Re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that our HHCL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves the performance of unsupervised person Re-ID.

Recently, learning from synthetic data, which benefits from the popularity of synthetic data engine, have achieved remarkable performance. However, existing synthetic datasets are in small size and lack of diversity, which hinders the development of person re-ID in real-world scenarios. To address this problem, firstly, we develop a large-scale synthetic data engine, the salient characteristic of this engine is controllable. Based on it, we build a large-scale synthetic dataset, which are diversified and customized from different attributes, such as illumination and viewpoint. Secondly, we quantitatively analyze the influence of dataset attributes on re-ID system. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly dissect person re-ID from the aspect of attribute on synthetic dataset. Comprehensive experiments help us have a deeper understanding of the fundamental problems in person re-ID. Our research also provides useful insights for dataset building and future practical usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Practical Implementations of Person Re-Identification from Full Video Frames](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01377v1)** | 2020-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the major adoption of automation for cities security, person re-identification (Re-ID) has been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we argue that the current way of studying person re-identification, i.e. by trying to re-identify a person within already detected and pre-cropped images of people, is not sufficient to implement practical security applications, where the inputs to the system are the full frames of the video streams. To support this claim, we introduce the Full Frame Person Re-ID setting (FF-PRID) and define specific metrics to evaluate FF-PRID implementations. To improve robustness, we also formalize the hybrid human-machine collaboration framework, which is inherent to any Re-ID security applications. To demonstrate the importance of considering the FF-PRID setting, we build an experiment showing that combining a good people detection network with a good Re-ID model does not necessarily produce good results for the final application. This underlines a failure of the current formulation in assessing the quality of a Re-ID model and justifies the use of different metrics. We hope that this work will motivate the research community to consider the full problem in order to develop algorithms that are better suited to real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, This paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |
| **[Pose Invariant Person Re-Identification using Robust Pose-transformation GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00930v2)** | 2021-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of person re-identification (re-ID) is to retrieve a person's images from an image gallery, given a single instance of the person of interest. Despite several advancements, learning discriminative identity-sensitive and viewpoint invariant features for robust Person Re-identification is a major challenge owing to the large pose variation of humans. This paper proposes a re-ID pipeline that utilizes the image generation capability of Generative Adversarial Networks combined with pose clustering and feature fusion to achieve pose invariant feature learning. The objective is to model a given person under different viewpoints and large pose changes and extract the most discriminative features from all the appearances. The pose transformational GAN (pt-GAN) module is trained to generate a person's image in any given pose. In order to identify the most significant poses for discriminative feature extraction, a Pose Clustering module is proposed. The given instance of the person is modelled in varying poses and these features are effectively combined through the Feature Fusion Network. The final re-ID model consisting of these 3 sub-blocks, alleviates the pose dependence in person re-ID. Also, The proposed model is robust to occlusion, scale, rotation and illumination, providing a framework for viewpoint invariant feature learning. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art GAN based models in 4 benchmark datasets. It also surpasses the state-of-the-art models that report higher re-ID accuracy in terms of improvement over baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Undergraduate thesis at Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Under review in IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMCA)</p></details> |

This ignores their joint benefit and mutual complementary effects. In this work, we show the advantages of jointly learning local and global features in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by aiming to discover correlated local and global features in different context. Specifically, we formulate a method for joint learning of local and global feature selection losses designed to optimise person re-id when using only generic matching metrics such as the L2 distance. We design a novel CNN architecture for Jointly Learning Multi-Loss (JLML) of local and global discriminative feature optimisation subject concurrently to the same re-id labelled information. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the advantages of this new JLML model for person re-id over a wide range of state-of-the-art re-id methods on five benchmarks (VIPeR, GRID, CUHK01, CUHK03, Market-1501).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2017</p></details> |
| **[Using Auxiliary Information for Person Re-Identification -- A Tutorial Overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08565v1)** | 2022-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-id) is a pivotal task within an intelligent surveillance pipeline and there exist numerous re-id frameworks that achieve satisfactory performance in challenging benchmarks. However, these systems struggle to generate acceptable results when there are significant differences between the camera views, illumination conditions, or occlusions. This result can be attributed to the deficiency that exists within many recently proposed re-id pipelines where they are predominately driven by appearance-based features and little attention is paid to other auxiliary information that could aid the re-id. In this paper, we systematically review the current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods in both uni-modal and multimodal person re-id. Extending beyond a conceptual framework, we illustrate how the existing SOTA methods can be extended to support these additional auxiliary information and quantitatively evaluate the utility of such auxiliary feature information, ranging from logos printed on the objects carried by the subject or printed on the clothes worn by the subject, through to his or her behavioural trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the fusion of multiple information to generate a more discriminant person descriptor and the principal aim of this paper is to provide a thorough theoretical analysis regarding the implementation of such a framework. In addition, using model interpretation techniques, we validate the contributions from different combinations of the auxiliary information versus the original features that the SOTA person re-id models extract. We outline the limitations of the proposed approaches and propose future research directions that could be pursued to advance the area of multi-modal person re-id.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint Submitted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

| **[Divide and Fuse: A Re-ranking Approach for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.04169v1)** | 2017-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As re-ranking is a necessary procedure to boost person re-identification (re-ID) performance on large-scale datasets, the diversity of feature becomes crucial to person reID for its importance both on designing pedestrian descriptions and re-ranking based on feature fusion. However, in many circumstances, only one type of pedestrian feature is available. In this paper, we propose a "Divide and use" re-ranking framework for person re-ID. It exploits the diversity from different parts of a high-dimensional feature vector for fusion-based re-ranking, while no other features are accessible. Specifically, given an image, the extracted feature is divided into sub-features. Then the contextual information of each sub-feature is iteratively encoded into a new feature. Finally, the new features from the same image are fused into one vector for re-ranking. Experimental results on two person re-ID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Especially, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Market-1501 dataset.</p></details> | Accepted by BMVC2017 |
| **[Adaptive Exploration for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04194v2)** | 2020-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to domain bias, directly deploying a deep person re-identification (re-ID) model trained on one dataset often achieves considerably poor accuracy on another dataset. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Exploration (AE) method to address the domain-shift problem for re-ID in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, in the target domain, the re-ID model is inducted to 1) maximize distances between all person images and 2) minimize distances between similar person images. In the first case, by treating each person image as an individual class, a non-parametric classifier with a feature memory is exploited to encourage person images to move far away from each other. In the second case, according to a similarity threshold, our method adaptively selects neighborhoods for each person image in the feature space. By treating these similar person images as the same class, the non-parametric classifier forces them to stay closer. However, a problem of the adaptive selection is that, when an image has too many neighborhoods, it is more likely to attract other images as its neighborhoods. As a result, a minority of images may select a large number of neighborhoods while a majority of images have only a few neighborhoods. To address this issue, we additionally integrate a balance strategy into the adaptive selection. We evaluate our methods with two protocols. The first one is called "target-only re-ID", in which only the unlabeled target data is used for training. The second one is called "domain adaptive re-ID", in which both the source data and the target data are used during training. Experimental results on large-scale re-ID datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code has been released at https://github.com/dyh127/Adaptive-Exploration-for-Unsupervised-Person-Re-Identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Application (TOMCCAP)</p></details> |

Most Re-ID methods formulate it as visual representation learning and image search, and its accuracy is consequently affected greatly by the search space. Spatial-temporal information has been proven to be efficient to filter irrelevant negative samples and significantly improve Re-ID accuracy. However, existing spatial-temporal person Re-ID methods are still rough and do not exploit spatial-temporal information sufficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel Instance-level and Spatial-Temporal Disentangled Re-ID method (InSTD), to improve Re-ID accuracy. In our proposed framework, personalized information such as moving direction is explicitly considered to further narrow down the search space. Besides, the spatial-temporal transferring probability is disentangled from joint distribution to marginal distribution, so that outliers can also be well modeled. Abundant experimental analyses are presented, which demonstrates the superiority and provides more insights into our method. The proposed method achieves mAP of 90.8% on Market-1501 and 89.1% on DukeMTMC-reID, improving from the baseline 82.2% and 72.7%, respectively.

The batch-hard triplet loss frequently used in video-based person Re-ID suffers from the Distance Variance among Different Positives (DVDP) problem. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a new metric learning method called Attribute-aware Identity-hard Triplet Loss (AITL), which reduces the intra-class variation among positive samples via calculating attribute distance. To achieve a complete model of video-based person Re-ID, a multi-task framework with Attribute-driven Spatio-Temporal Attention (ASTA) mechanism is also proposed. Extensive experiments on MARS and DukeMTMC-VID datasets shows that both the AITL and ASTA are very effective. Enhanced by them, even a simple light-weighted video-based person Re-ID baseline can outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Learning Multi-Attention Context Graph for Group-Based Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14236v1)** | 2021-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to re-identify or retrieve a group of people across non-overlapped camera systems has important applications in video surveillance. However, most existing methods focus on (single) person re-identification (re-id), ignoring the fact that people often walk in groups in real scenarios. In this work, we take a step further and consider employing context information for identifying groups of people, i.e., group re-id. We propose a novel unified framework based on graph neural networks to simultaneously address the group-based re-id tasks, i.e., group re-id and group-aware person re-id. Specifically, we construct a context graph with group members as its nodes to exploit dependencies among different people. A multi-level attention mechanism is developed to formulate both intra-group and inter-group context, with an additional self-attention module for robust graph-level representations by attentively aggregating node-level features. The proposed model can be directly generalized to tackle group-aware person re-id using node-level representations. Meanwhile, to facilitate the deployment of deep learning models on these tasks, we build a new group re-id dataset that contains more than 3.8K images with 1.5K annotated groups, an order of magnitude larger than existing group re-id datasets. Extensive experiments on the novel dataset as well as three existing datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both group-based re-id tasks.

In this paper, we propose to retrieve a full-body person image by using a person image with occlusions. This differs significantly from the conventional person re-id problem where it is assumed that person images are detected without any occlusion. We thus call this new problem the occluded person re-identitification. To address this new problem, we propose a novel Attention Framework of Person Body (AFPB) based on deep learning, consisting of 1) an Occlusion Simulator (OS) which automatically generates artificial occlusions for full-body person images, and 2) multi-task losses that force the neural network not only to discriminate a person's identity but also to determine whether a sample is from the occluded data distribution or the full-body data distribution. Experiments on a new occluded person re-id dataset and three existing benchmarks modified to include full-body person images and occluded person images show the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, IEEE International Conference of Multimedia and Expo 2018</p></details> |

Generally, supervised ImageNet pretraining is commonly used to initialize the backbones of person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, recent works show a surprising result that CNN-based pretraining on ImageNet has limited impacts on Re-ID system due to the large domain gap between ImageNet and person Re-ID data. To seek an alternative to traditional pretraining, here we investigate semantic-based pretraining as another method to utilize additional textual data against ImageNet pretraining. Specifically, we manually construct a diversified FineGPR-C caption dataset for the first time on person Re-ID events. Based on it, a pure semantic-based pretraining approach named VTBR is proposed to adopt dense captions to learn visual representations with fewer images. We train convolutional neural networks from scratch on the captions of FineGPR-C dataset, and then transfer them to downstream Re-ID tasks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show that our VTBR can achieve competitive performance compared with ImageNet pretraining - despite using up to 1.4x fewer images, revealing its potential in Re-ID pretraining.</p></details> |  |

One major challenge comes from the imbalanced long-tail person identity distributions, which prevents the one-step person search model from learning discriminative person features for the final re-identification. However, it is under-explored how to solve the heavy imbalanced identity distributions for the one-step person search. Techniques designed for the long-tail classification task, for example, image-level re-sampling strategies, are hard to be effectively applied to the one-step person search which jointly solves person detection and Re-ID subtasks with a detection-based multi-task framework. To tackle this problem, we propose a Subtask-dominated Transfer Learning (STL) method. The STL method solves the long-tail problem in the pretraining stage of the dominated Re-ID subtask and improves the one-step person search by transfer learning of the pretrained model. We further design a Multi-level RoI Fusion Pooling layer to enhance the discrimination ability of person features for the one-step person search. Extensive experiments on CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Normalized Image Generation for Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.02225v6)** | 2018-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Re-identification (re-id) faces two major challenges: the lack of cross-view paired training data and learning discriminative identity-sensitive and view-invariant features in the presence of large pose variations. In this work, we address both problems by proposing a novel deep person image generation model for synthesizing realistic person images conditional on the pose. The model is based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) designed specifically for pose normalization in re-id, thus termed pose-normalization GAN (PN-GAN). With the synthesized images, we can learn a new type of deep re-id feature free of the influence of pose variations. We show that this feature is strong on its own and complementary to features learned with the original images. Importantly, under the transfer learning setting, we show that our model generalizes well to any new re-id dataset without the need for collecting any training data for model fine-tuning. The model thus has the potential to make re-id model truly scalable.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Combining Two Adversarial Attacks Against Person Re-Identification Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13763v1)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) has received much attention recently, driven by the progress of deep neural networks, especially for image classification. The problem of Re-ID consists in identifying individuals through images captured by surveillance cameras in different scenarios. Governments and companies are investing a lot of time and money in Re-ID systems for use in public safety and identifying missing persons. However, several challenges remain for successfully implementing Re-ID, such as occlusions and light reflections in people's images. In this work, we focus on adversarial attacks on Re-ID systems, which can be a critical threat to the performance of these systems. In particular, we explore the combination of adversarial attacks against Re-ID models, trying to strengthen the decrease in the classification results. We conduct our experiments on three datasets: DukeMTMC-ReID, Market-1501, and CUHK03. We combine the use of two types of adversarial attacks, P-FGSM and Deep Mis-Ranking, applied to two popular Re-ID models: IDE (ResNet-50) and AlignedReID. The best result demonstrates a decrease of 3.36% in the Rank-10 metric for AlignedReID applied to CUHK03. We also try to use Dropout during the inference as a defense method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intra-Camera Supervised Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05046v3)** | 2021-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing person re-identification (re-id) methods mostly exploit a large set of cross-camera identity labelled training data. This requires a tedious data collection and annotation process, leading to poor scalability in practical re-id applications. On the other hand unsupervised re-id methods do not need identity label information, but they usually suffer from much inferior and insufficient model performance. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose a novel person re-identification paradigm based on an idea of independent per-camera identity annotation. This eliminates the most time-consuming and tedious inter-camera identity labelling process, significantly reducing the amount of human annotation efforts. Consequently, it gives rise to a more scalable and more feasible setting, which we call Intra-Camera Supervised (ICS) person re-id, for which we formulate a Multi-tAsk mulTi-labEl (MATE) deep learning method. Specifically, MATE is designed for self-discovering the cross-camera identity correspondence in a per-camera multi-task inference framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the cost-effectiveness superiority of our method over the alternative approaches on three large person re-id datasets. For example, MATE yields 88.7% rank-1 score on Market-1501 in the proposed ICS person re-id setting, significantly outperforming unsupervised learning models and closely approaching conventional fully supervised learning competitors.</p></details> | Accepted to IJCV |
| **[Unsupervised Tracklet Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00535v1)** | 2019-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing person re-identification (re-id) methods rely on supervised model learning on per-camera-pair manually labelled pairwise training data. This leads to poor scalability in a practical re-id deployment, due to the lack of exhaustive identity labelling of positive and negative image pairs for every camera-pair. In this work, we present an unsupervised re-id deep learning approach. It is capable of incrementally discovering and exploiting the underlying re-id discriminative information from automatically generated person tracklet data end-to-end. We formulate an Unsupervised Tracklet Association Learning (UTAL) framework. This is by jointly learning within-camera tracklet discrimination and cross-camera tracklet association in order to maximise the discovery of tracklet identity matching both within and across camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning and domain adaptation person re-id methods on eight benchmarking datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

| **[advPattern: Physical-World Attacks on Deep Person Re-Identification via Adversarially Transformable Patterns](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.09327v3)** | 2019-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (re-ID) is the task of matching person images across camera views, which plays an important role in surveillance and security applications. Inspired by great progress of deep learning, deep re-ID models began to be popular and gained state-of-the-art performance. However, recent works found that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, posing potential threats to DNNs based applications. This phenomenon throws a serious question about whether deep re-ID based systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we take the first attempt to implement robust physical-world attacks against deep re-ID. We propose a novel attack algorithm, called advPattern, for generating adversarial patterns on clothes, which learns the variations of image pairs across cameras to pull closer the image features from the same camera, while pushing features from different cameras farther. By wearing our crafted "invisible cloak", an adversary can evade person search, or impersonate a target person to fool deep re-ID models in physical world. We evaluate the effectiveness of our transformable patterns on adversaries'clothes with Market1501 and our established PRCS dataset. The experimental results show that the rank-1 accuracy of re-ID models for matching the adversary decreases from 87.9% to 27.1% under Evading Attack. Furthermore, the adversary can impersonate a target person with 47.1% rank-1 accuracy and 67.9% mAP under Impersonation Attack. The results demonstrate that deep re-ID systems are vulnerable to our physical attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, Accepted by ICCV 2019</p></details> |
| **[PH-GCN: Person Re-identification with Part-based Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08822v1)** | 2019-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The person re-identification (Re-ID) task requires to robustly extract feature representations for person images. Recently, part-based representation models have been widely studied for extracting the more compact and robust feature representations for person images to improve person Re-ID results. However, existing part-based representation models mostly extract the features of different parts independently which ignore the relationship information between different parts. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose a novel deep learning framework, named Part-based Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (PH-GCN) for person Re-ID problem. Given a person image, PH-GCN first constructs a hierarchical graph to represent the pairwise relationships among different parts. Then, both local and global feature learning are performed by the messages passing in PH-GCN, which takes other nodes information into account for part feature representation. Finally, a perceptron layer is adopted for the final person part label prediction and re-identification. The proposed framework provides a general solution that integrates local, global and structural feature learning simultaneously in a unified end-to-end network. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PH-GCN based Re-ID approach.</p></details> |  |

It aims to automatically identify/search persons in a multi-camera network having non-overlapping field-of-views. Owing to its potential in various applications and research significance, a plethora of deep learning based re-Id approaches have been proposed in the recent years. However, there exist several vision related challenges, e.g., occlusion, pose scale \& viewpoint variance, background clutter, person misalignment and cross-domain generalization across camera modalities, which makes the problem of re-Id still far from being solved. Majority of the proposed approaches directly or indirectly aim to solve one or multiple of these existing challenges. In this context, a comprehensive review of current re-ID approaches in solving theses challenges is needed to analyze and focus on particular aspects for further advancements. At present, such a focused review does not exist and henceforth in this paper, we have presented a systematic challenge-specific literature survey of 230+ papers between the years of 2015-21. For the first time a survey of this type have been presented where the person re-Id approaches are reviewed in such solution-oriented perspective. Moreover, we have presented several diversified prominent developing trends in the respective research domain which will provide a visionary perspective regarding ongoing person re-Id research and eventually help to develop practical real world solutions.</p></details> |  |

Lots of researchers recently focuse on this hot issue and propose deep learning based methods to enhance the recognition rate in a supervised or unsupervised manner. However, two limitations that cannot be ignored: firstly, compared with other image retrieval benchmarks, the size of existing person Re-Id datasets are far from meeting the requirement, which cannot provide sufficient pedestrian samples for the training of deep model; secondly, the samples in existing datasets do not have sufficient human motions or postures coverage to provide more priori knowledges for learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised pose augmentation cross-view person Re-Id scheme called PAC-GAN to overcome these limitations. We firstly present the formal definition of cross-view pose augmentation and then propose the framework of PAC-GAN that is a novel conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) based approach to improve the performance of unsupervised corss-view person Re-Id. Specifically, The pose generation model in PAC-GAN called CPG-Net is to generate enough quantity of pose-rich samples from original image and skeleton samples. The pose augmentation dataset is produced by combining the synthesized pose-rich samples with the original samples, which is fed into the corss-view person Re-Id model named Cross-GAN. Besides, we use weight-sharing strategy in the CPG-Net to improve the quality of new generated samples. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first try to enhance the unsupervised cross-view person Re-Id by pose augmentation, and the results of extensive experiments show that the proposed scheme can combat the state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | 32 pages |

To ensure that transformed images are as realistic as possible, we propose novel identity mapping and semantic consistency losses to maintain identity across the diverse domains. For the Re-ID task, we propose a joint verification-identification quartet network which is trained with generated and real images, followed by an effective quartet loss for verification.

Existing methods for re-ID tend to rely heavily on the assumption that both query and gallery images of the same person have the same clothing. Unfortunately, this assumption may not hold for datasets captured over long periods of time (e.g., weeks, months or years). To tackle the re-ID problem in the context of clothing changes, we propose a novel representation learning model which is able to generate a body shape feature representation without being affected by clothing color or patterns. We call our model the Color Agnostic Shape Extraction Network (CASE-Net). CASE-Net learns a representation of identity that depends only on body shape via adversarial learning and feature disentanglement. Due to the lack of large-scale re-ID datasets which contain clothing changes for the same person, we propose two synthetic datasets for evaluation. We create a rendered dataset SMPL-reID with different clothes patterns and a synthesized dataset Div-Market with different clothing color to simulate two types of clothing changes. The quantitative and qualitative results across 5 datasets (SMPL-reID, Div-Market, two benchmark re-ID datasets, a cross-modality re-ID dataset) confirm the robustness and superiority of our approach against several state-of-the-art approaches</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Edit One for All: Interactive Batch Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10219v1)** | 2024-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, image editing has advanced remarkably. With increased human control, it is now possible to edit an image in a plethora of ways; from specifying in text what we want to change, to straight up dragging the contents of the image in an interactive point-based manner. However, most of the focus has remained on editing single images at a time. Whether and how we can simultaneously edit large batches of images has remained understudied. With the goal of minimizing human supervision in the editing process, this paper presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g., make the face frontal), our method can automatically transfer that edit to other test images, so that regardless of their initial state (pose), they all arrive at the same final state (e.g., all facing front). Extensive experiments demonstrate that edits performed using our method have similar visual quality to existing single-image-editing methods, while having more visual consistency and saving significant time and human effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thaoshibe.github.io/edit-one-for-all/</p></details> |
| **[Step1X-Edit: A Practical Framework for General Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17761v5)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step1X-Edit</p></details> |
| **[Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04394v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[EditCLIP: Representation Learning for Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20318v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce EditCLIP, a novel representation-learning approach for image editing. Our method learns a unified representation of edits by jointly encoding an input image and its edited counterpart, effectively capturing their transformation. To evaluate its effectiveness, we employ EditCLIP to solve two tasks: exemplar-based image editing and automated edit evaluation. In exemplar-based image editing, we replace text-based instructions in InstructPix2Pix with EditCLIP embeddings computed from a reference exemplar image pair. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being more efficient and versatile. For automated evaluation, EditCLIP assesses image edits by measuring the similarity between the EditCLIP embedding of a given image pair and either a textual editing instruction or the EditCLIP embedding of another reference image pair. Experiments show that EditCLIP aligns more closely with human judgments than existing CLIP-based metrics, providing a reliable measure of edit quality and structural preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qianwangx.github.io/EditCLIP/</p></details> |
| **[NEP: Autoregressive Image Editing via Next Editing Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06044v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in (1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot manner.

As the quality of base-model generated images continues to improve, so does the demand for further application like image editing. In recent years, many remarkable works are realizing a wide variety of editing effects. However, the wide variety of editing types and diverse editing approaches have made it difficult for researchers to establish a comprehensive view of the development of this field. In this survey, we summarize the image editing field from four aspects: tasks definition, methods classification, results evaluation and editing datasets. First, we provide a definition of image editing, which in turn leads to a variety of editing task forms from the perspective of operation parts and manipulation actions. Subsequently, we categorize and summary methods for implementing editing into three categories: inversion-based, fine-tuning-based and adapter-based. In addition, we organize the currently used metrics, available datasets and corresponding construction methods. At the end, we present some visions for the future development of the image editing field based on the previous summaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning an Image Editing Model without Image Editing Pairs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14978v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data, our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://nupurkmr9.github.io/npedit/</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches relying on attribute guidance or human feedback on building datasets, we devise a scalable data collection pipeline leveraging advanced foundation models, namely GPT-4V and DALL-E 3. To ensure its high quality, diverse examples are first collected online, expanded, and then used to create high-quality diptychs featuring input and output images with detailed text prompts, followed by precise alignment ensured through post-processing. In addition, we propose two evaluation metrics, Alignment and Coherence, to quantitatively assess the quality of image edit pairs using GPT-4V. HQ-Edits high-resolution images, rich in detail and accompanied by comprehensive editing prompts, substantially enhance the capabilities of existing image editing models. For example, an HQ-Edit finetuned InstructPix2Pix can attain state-of-the-art image editing performance, even surpassing those models fine-tuned with human-annotated data.

However, current models in this domain often struggle with accurately executing user instructions. We present Emu Edit, a multi-task image editing model which sets state-of-the-art results in instruction-based image editing. To develop Emu Edit we train it to multi-task across an unprecedented range of tasks, such as region-based editing, free-form editing, and Computer Vision tasks, all of which are formulated as generative tasks. Additionally, to enhance Emu Edit's multi-task learning abilities, we provide it with learned task embeddings which guide the generation process towards the correct edit type. Both these elements are essential for Emu Edit's outstanding performance. Furthermore, we show that Emu Edit can generalize to new tasks, such as image inpainting, super-resolution, and compositions of editing tasks, with just a few labeled examples. This capability offers a significant advantage in scenarios where high-quality samples are scarce. Lastly, to facilitate a more rigorous and informed assessment of instructable image editing models, we release a new challenging and versatile benchmark that includes seven different image editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by these efforts, in this paper we propose a unified model for open-domain image editing focusing on color and tone adjustment of open-domain images while keeping their original content and structure. Our model learns a unified editing space that is more semantic, intuitive, and easy to manipulate than the operation space (e.g., contrast, brightness, color curve) used in many existing photo editing softwares. Our model belongs to the image-to-image translation framework which consists of an image encoder and decoder, and is trained on pairs of before- and after-images to produce multimodal outputs. We show that by inverting image pairs into latent codes of the learned editing space, our model can be leveraged for various downstream editing tasks such as language-guided image editing, personalized editing, editing-style clustering, retrieval, etc. We extensively study the unique properties of the editing space in experiments and demonstrate superior performance on the aforementioned tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our framework extends the recent Image2StyleGAN in three ways. First, we introduce noise optimization as a complement to the $W^+$ latent space embedding. Our noise optimization can restore high-frequency features in images and thus significantly improves the quality of reconstructed images, e.g. a big increase of PSNR from 20 dB to 45 dB. Second, we extend the global $W^+$ latent space embedding to enable local embeddings. Third, we combine embedding with activation tensor manipulation to perform high-quality local edits along with global semantic edits on images. Such edits motivate various high-quality image editing applications, e.g. image reconstruction, image inpainting, image crossover, local style transfer, image editing using scribbles, and attribute level feature transfer. Examples of the edited images are shown across the paper for visual inspection.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2020 " For the video, visit https://youtu.be/yd5WczbFt68 "</p></details> |

SEED-Data-Edit is composed of three distinct types of data: (1) High-quality editing data produced by an automated pipeline, ensuring a substantial volume of diverse image editing pairs. (2) Real-world scenario data collected from the internet, which captures the intricacies of user intentions for promoting the practical application of image editing in the real world. (3) High-precision multi-turn editing data annotated by humans, which involves multiple rounds of edits for simulating iterative editing processes. The combination of these diverse data sources makes SEED-Data-Edit a comprehensive and versatile dataset for training language-guided image editing model.

| **[Pathways on the Image Manifold: Image Editing via Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16819v4)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image editing, driven by image diffusion models, have shown remarkable progress. However, significant challenges remain, as these models often struggle to follow complex edit instructions accurately and frequently compromise fidelity by altering key elements of the original image. Simultaneously, video generation has made remarkable strides, with models that effectively function as consistent and continuous world simulators. In this paper, we propose merging these two fields by utilizing image-to-video models for image editing. We reformulate image editing as a temporal process, using pretrained video models to create smooth transitions from the original image to the desired edit. This approach traverses the image manifold continuously, ensuring consistent edits while preserving the original image's key aspects. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on text-based image editing, demonstrating significant improvements in both edit accuracy and image preservation.

| **[Image Editing As Programs with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04158v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions.

| **[Counterfactual Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09683v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual image editing is an important task in generative AI, which asks how an image would look if certain features were different. The current literature on the topic focuses primarily on changing individual features while remaining silent about the causal relationships between these features, as present in the real world. In this paper, we formalize the counterfactual image editing task using formal language, modeling the causal relationships between latent generative factors and images through a special type of model called augmented structural causal models (ASCMs). Second, we show two fundamental impossibility results: (1) counterfactual editing is impossible from i.i.d. image samples and their corresponding labels alone; (2) even when the causal relationships between the latent generative factors and images are available, no guarantees regarding the output of the model can be provided. Third, we propose a relaxation for this challenging problem by approximating non-identifiable counterfactual distributions with a new family of counterfactual-consistent estimators. This family exhibits the desirable property of preserving features that the user cares about across both factual and counterfactual worlds. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm to generate counterfactual images by leveraging neural causal models.</p></details> |  |

To obtain training data for this problem, we combine the knowledge of two large pretrained models -- a language model (GPT-3) and a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion) -- to generate a large dataset of image editing examples. Our conditional diffusion model, InstructPix2Pix, is trained on our generated data, and generalizes to real images and user-written instructions at inference time. Since it performs edits in the forward pass and does not require per example fine-tuning or inversion, our model edits images quickly, in a matter of seconds. We show compelling editing results for a diverse collection of input images and written instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page with code: https://www.timothybrooks.com/instruct-pix2pix</p></details> |

Existing methods rely on supervised learning with triplets of input images, ground-truth edited images, and edit instructions. These triplets are typically generated either by existing editing methods, introducing biases, or through human annotations, which are costly and limit generalization. Our approach addresses these challenges by introducing a novel editing mechanism called Edit Reversibility Constraint (ERC), which applies forward and reverse edits in one training step and enforces alignment in image, text, and attention spaces. This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth edited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising either real image-caption pairs or image-caption-instruction triplets. We empirically show that our approach performs better across a broader range of edits with high-fidelity and precision. By eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets of triplets, reducing biases associated with current methods, and proposing ERC, our work represents a significant advancement in unblocking scaling of instruction-based image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV'25.

| **[Warping the Residuals for Image Editing with StyleGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11422v1)** | 2023-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>StyleGAN models show editing capabilities via their semantically interpretable latent organizations which require successful GAN inversion methods to edit real images. Many works have been proposed for inverting images into StyleGAN's latent space. However, their results either suffer from low fidelity to the input image or poor editing qualities, especially for edits that require large transformations. That is because low-rate latent spaces lose many image details due to the information bottleneck even though it provides an editable space. On the other hand, higher-rate latent spaces can pass all the image details to StyleGAN for perfect reconstruction of images but suffer from low editing qualities. In this work, we present a novel image inversion architecture that extracts high-rate latent features and includes a flow estimation module to warp these features to adapt them to edits. The flows are estimated from StyleGAN features of edited and unedited latent codes. By estimating the high-rate features and warping them for edits, we achieve both high-fidelity to the input image and high-quality edits. We run extensive experiments and compare our method with state-of-the-art inversion methods. Qualitative metrics and visual comparisons show significant improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edit as You See: Image-guided Video Editing via Masked Motion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04325v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly facilitated text-guided video editing. However, there is a relative scarcity of research on image-guided video editing, a method that empowers users to edit videos by merely indicating a target object in the initial frame and providing an RGB image as reference, without relying on the text prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel Image-guided Video Editing Diffusion model, termed IVEDiff for the image-guided video editing. IVEDiff is built on top of image editing models, and is equipped with learnable motion modules to maintain the temporal consistency of edited video. Inspired by self-supervised learning concepts, we introduce a masked motion modeling fine-tuning strategy that empowers the motion module's capabilities for capturing inter-frame motion dynamics, while preserving the capabilities for intra-frame semantic correlations modeling of the base image editing model. Moreover, an optical-flow-guided motion reference network is proposed to ensure the accurate propagation of information between edited video frames, alleviating the misleading effects of invalid information. We also construct a benchmark to facilitate further research. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method is able to generate temporally smooth edited videos while robustly dealing with various editing objects with high quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-aware Inversion and Reassembly for Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12149v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By comparing the original and target prompts, we can obtain numerous editing pairs, each comprising an object and its corresponding editing target. To allow editability while maintaining fidelity to the input image, existing editing methods typically involve a fixed number of inversion steps that project the whole input image to its noisier latent representation, followed by a denoising process guided by the target prompt. However, we find that the optimal number of inversion steps for achieving ideal editing results varies significantly among different editing pairs, owing to varying editing difficulties. Therefore, the current literature, which relies on a fixed number of inversion steps, produces sub-optimal generation quality, especially when handling multiple editing pairs in a natural image. To this end, we propose a new image editing paradigm, dubbed Object-aware Inversion and Reassembly (OIR), to enable object-level fine-grained editing. Specifically, we design a new search metric, which determines the optimal inversion steps for each editing pair, by jointly considering the editability of the target and the fidelity of the non-editing region. We use our search metric to find the optimal inversion step for each editing pair when editing an image. We then edit these editing pairs separately to avoid concept mismatch. Subsequently, we propose an additional reassembly step to seamlessly integrate the respective editing results and the non-editing region to obtain the final edited image. To systematically evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we collect two datasets called OIRBench for benchmarking single- and multi-object editing, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in editing object shapes, colors, materials, categories, etc., especially in multi-object editing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aim-uofa.github.io/OIR-Diffusion/</p></details> |
| **[EditTrack: Detecting and Attributing AI-assisted Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01173v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so, by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstructGIE: Towards Generalizable Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05018v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image editing have been driven by the development of denoising diffusion models, marking a significant leap forward in this field. Despite these advances, the generalization capabilities of recent image editing approaches remain constrained. In response to this challenge, our study introduces a novel image editing framework with enhanced generalization robustness by boosting in-context learning capability and unifying language instruction. This framework incorporates a module specifically optimized for image editing tasks, leveraging the VMamba Block and an editing-shift matching strategy to augment in-context learning. Furthermore, we unveil a selective area-matching technique specifically engineered to address and rectify corrupted details in generated images, such as human facial features, to further improve the quality. Another key innovation of our approach is the integration of a language unification technique, which aligns language embeddings with editing semantics to elevate the quality of image editing. Moreover, we compile the first dataset for image editing with visual prompts and editing instructions that could be used to enhance in-context capability. Trained on this dataset, our methodology not only achieves superior synthesis quality for trained tasks, but also demonstrates robust generalization capability across unseen vision tasks through tailored prompts.</p></details> | ECCV2024 |

However, editing user-provided images remains challenging, as the high dimensional noise input space of diffusion models is not naturally suited for image inversion or spatial editing. In this work, we propose an image representation that promotes spatial editing of input images using a diffusion model. Concretely, we learn to encode an input into "image elements" that can faithfully reconstruct an input image. These elements can be intuitively edited by a user, and are decoded by a diffusion model into realistic images. We show the effectiveness of our representation on various image editing tasks, such as object resizing, rearrangement, dragging, de-occlusion, removal, variation, and image composition.

It is widely studied in recent years as a promising and challenging field of Artificial Intelligence Generative Content (AIGC). Recent significant advancement in this field is based on the development of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which generate images according to text prompts. These models demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities and have become widely used tools for image editing. T2I-based image editing methods significantly enhance editing performance and offer a user-friendly interface for modifying content guided by multimodal inputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal-guided image editing techniques that leverage T2I diffusion models. First, we define the scope of image editing from a holistic perspective and detail various control signals and editing scenarios. We then propose a unified framework to formalize the editing process, categorizing it into two primary algorithm families. This framework offers a design space for users to achieve specific goals. Subsequently, we present an in-depth analysis of each component within this framework, examining the characteristics and applicable scenarios of different combinations. Given that training-based methods learn to directly map the source image to target one under user guidance, we discuss them separately, and introduce injection schemes of source image in different scenarios. Additionally, we review the application of 2D techniques to video editing, highlighting solutions for inter-frame inconsistency. Finally, we discuss open challenges in the field and suggest potential future research directions.

Compared to UNet, Diffusion Transformers (DiT) demonstrate superior capabilities to effectively capture the long-range dependencies among patches, leading to higher-quality image generation. In this paper, we propose DiT4Edit, the first Diffusion Transformer-based image editing framework. Specifically, DiT4Edit uses the DPM-Solver inversion algorithm to obtain the inverted latents, reducing the number of steps compared to the DDIM inversion algorithm commonly used in UNet-based frameworks. Additionally, we design unified attention control and patches merging, tailored for transformer computation streams. This integration allows our framework to generate higher-quality edited images faster. Our design leverages the advantages of DiT, enabling it to surpass UNet structures in image editing, especially in high-resolution and arbitrary-size images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of DiT4Edit across various editing scenarios, highlighting the potential of Diffusion Transformers in supporting image editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[EditGAN: High-Precision Semantic Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03186v1)** | 2021-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have recently found applications in image editing. However, most GAN based image editing methods often require large scale datasets with semantic segmentation annotations for training, only provide high level control, or merely interpolate between different images. Here, we propose EditGAN, a novel method for high quality, high precision semantic image editing, allowing users to edit images by modifying their highly detailed part segmentation masks, e.g., drawing a new mask for the headlight of a car. EditGAN builds on a GAN framework that jointly models images and their semantic segmentations, requiring only a handful of labeled examples, making it a scalable tool for editing. Specifically, we embed an image into the GAN latent space and perform conditional latent code optimization according to the segmentation edit, which effectively also modifies the image. To amortize optimization, we find editing vectors in latent space that realize the edits. The framework allows us to learn an arbitrary number of editing vectors, which can then be directly applied on other images at interactive rates. We experimentally show that EditGAN can manipulate images with an unprecedented level of detail and freedom, while preserving full image quality.We can also easily combine multiple edits and perform plausible edits beyond EditGAN training data. We demonstrate EditGAN on a wide variety of image types and quantitatively outperform several previous editing methods on standard editing benchmark tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Relative Attention Guidance for Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24657v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.</p></details> |  |

Besides, we also propose a baseline method that fully utilizes the annotation to solve this problem. Our new method treats each editing operation as a sub-module and can automatically predict operation parameters. Not only performing well on challenging user data, but such an approach is also highly interpretable. We believe our work, including both the benchmark and the baseline, will advance the image editing area towards a more general and free-form level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACCV 2020</p></details> |

In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.</p></details> |  |

The challenges are to accept multimodal inputs as instructions and a scarcity of high-quality training data, including crucial triplets of source/target image pairs and multimodal (text and image) instructions. In this paper, we focus on image style editing and present StyleBooth, a method that proposes a comprehensive framework for image editing and a feasible strategy for building a high-quality style editing dataset. We integrate encoded textual instruction and image exemplar as a unified condition for diffusion model, enabling the editing of original image following multimodal instructions. Furthermore, by iterative style-destyle tuning and editing and usability filtering, the StyleBooth dataset provides content-consistent stylized/plain image pairs in various categories of styles. To show the flexibility of StyleBooth, we conduct experiments on diverse tasks, such as text-based style editing, exemplar-based style editing and compositional style editing. The results demonstrate that the quality and variety of training data significantly enhance the ability to preserve content and improve the overall quality of generated images in editing tasks.

However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts. In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such as makeup transfer.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality. High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between editability and content preservation.

It is widely recognized that employing larger inversion and denoising steps in diffusion model leads to improved image reconstruction quality. However, the editing performance of diffusion models tends to be no more satisfactory even with increasing denoising steps. The deficiency in editing could be attributed to the conditional Markovian property of the editing process, where errors accumulate throughout denoising steps. To tackle this challenge, we first propose an innovative framework where a rectifier module is incorporated to modulate diffusion model weights with residual features, thereby providing compensatory information to bridge the fidelity gap. Furthermore, we introduce a novel learning paradigm aimed at minimizing error propagation during the editing process, which trains the editing procedure in a manner similar to denoising score-matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework and training strategy achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and editing results across various levels of denoising steps, meanwhile exhibits exceptional performance in terms of both quantitative metric and qualitative assessments.

To address this issue, we propose Custom-Edit, in which we (i) customize a diffusion model with a few reference images and then (ii) perform text-guided editing. Our key discovery is that customizing only language-relevant parameters with augmented prompts improves reference similarity significantly while maintaining source similarity.

| **[CCR: Facial Image Editing with Continuity, Consistency and Reversibility](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10734v1)** | 2022-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three problems exist in sequential facial image editing: incontinuous editing, inconsistent editing, and irreversible editing. Incontinuous editing is that the current editing can not retain the previously edited attributes. Inconsistent editing is that swapping the attribute editing orders can not yield the same results. Irreversible editing means that operating on a facial image is irreversible, especially in sequential facial image editing. In this work, we put forward three concepts and corresponding definitions: editing continuity, consistency, and reversibility. Then, we propose a novel model to achieve the goal of editing continuity, consistency, and reversibility. A sufficient criterion is defined to determine whether a model is continuous, consistent, and reversible. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results validate our proposed model and show that a continuous, consistent and reversible editing model has a more flexible editing function while preserving facial identity. Furthermore, we think that our proposed definitions and model will have wide and promising applications in multimedia processing.

| **[Text-to-image Editing by Image Information Removal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.17489v2)** | 2023-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in text-guided image generation. Current methods that leverage the knowledge of these models for image editing either fine-tune them using the input image (e.g., Imagic) or incorporate structure information as additional constraints (e.g., ControlNet). However, fine-tuning large-scale diffusion models on a single image can lead to severe overfitting issues and lengthy inference time. Information leakage from pretrained models also make it challenging to preserve image content not related to the text input. Additionally, methods that incorporate structural guidance (e.g., edge maps, semantic maps, keypoints) find retaining attributes like colors and textures difficult. Using the input image as a control could mitigate these issues, but since these models are trained via reconstruction, a model can simply hide information about the original image when encoding it to perfectly reconstruct the image without learning the editing task. To address these challenges, we propose a text-to-image editing model with an Image Information Removal module (IIR) that selectively erases color-related and texture-related information from the original image, allowing us to better preserve the text-irrelevant content and avoid issues arising from information hiding. Our experiments on CUB, Outdoor Scenes, and COCO reports our approach achieves the best editability-fidelity trade-off results. In addition, a user study on COCO shows that our edited images are preferred 35% more often than prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full paper is accepted by WACV2024; Best paper runner-up of AI4CC@CVPR 2023</p></details> |
| **[LayerDiffusion: Layered Controlled Image Editing with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18676v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing has recently experienced rapid development. However, simultaneously performing multiple editing actions on a single image, such as background replacement and specific subject attribute changes, while maintaining consistency between the subject and the background remains challenging. In this paper, we propose LayerDiffusion, a semantic-based layered controlled image editing method. Our method enables non-rigid editing and attribute modification of specific subjects while preserving their unique characteristics and seamlessly integrating them into new backgrounds. We leverage a large-scale text-to-image model and employ a layered controlled optimization strategy combined with layered diffusion training. During the diffusion process, an iterative guidance strategy is used to generate a final image that aligns with the textual description. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating highly coherent images that closely align with the given textual description. The edited images maintain a high similarity to the features of the input image and surpass the performance of current leading image editing methods. LayerDiffusion opens up new possibilities for controllable image editing.</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Tight Inversion: Image-Conditioned Inversion for Real Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20376v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models offer powerful image editing capabilities. To edit real images, many methods rely on the inversion of the image into Gaussian noise. A common approach to invert an image is to gradually add noise to the image, where the noise is determined by reversing the sampling equation. This process has an inherent tradeoff between reconstruction and editability, limiting the editing of challenging images such as highly-detailed ones. Recognizing the reliance of text-to-image models inversion on a text condition, this work explores the importance of the condition choice. We show that a condition that precisely aligns with the input image significantly improves the inversion quality. Based on our findings, we introduce Tight Inversion, an inversion method that utilizes the most possible precise condition -- the input image itself. This tight condition narrows the distribution of the model's output and enhances both reconstruction and editability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when combined with existing inversion methods through extensive experiments, evaluating the reconstruction accuracy as well as the integration with various editing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://tight-inversion.github.io</p></details> |
| **[X-Edit: Detecting and Localizing Edits in Images Altered by Text-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11753v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts. While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics. This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.</p></details> | CVPR (XAI4CV) 2025 |
| **[CAISE: Conversational Agent for Image Search and Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11847v1)** | 2022-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand for image editing has been increasing as users' desire for expression is also increasing. However, for most users, image editing tools are not easy to use since the tools require certain expertise in photo effects and have complex interfaces. Hence, users might need someone to help edit their images, but having a personal dedicated human assistant for every user is impossible to scale. For that reason, an automated assistant system for image editing is desirable. Additionally, users want more image sources for diverse image editing works, and integrating an image search functionality into the editing tool is a potential remedy for this demand. Thus, we propose a dataset of an automated Conversational Agent for Image Search and Editing (CAISE). To our knowledge, this is the first dataset that provides conversational image search and editing annotations, where the agent holds a grounded conversation with users and helps them to search and edit images according to their requests. To build such a system, we first collect image search and editing conversations between pairs of annotators. The assistant-annotators are equipped with a customized image search and editing tool to address the requests from the user-annotators. The functions that the assistant-annotators conduct with the tool are recorded as executable commands, allowing the trained system to be useful for real-world application execution. We also introduce a generator-extractor baseline model for this task, which can adaptively select the source of the next token (i.e., from the vocabulary or from textual/visual contexts) for the executable command. This serves as a strong starting point while still leaving a large human-machine performance gap for useful future work.

However, the proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity. These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in instruction-guided image editing.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Layered Diffusion Brushes (LDB), a novel training-free framework that enables interactive, layer-based editing using standard diffusion models. LDB defines each "layer" as a self-contained set of parameters guiding the generative process, enabling independent, non-destructive, and fine-grained prompt-guided edits, even in overlapping regions. LDB leverages a unique intermediate latent caching approach to reduce each edit to only a few denoising steps, achieving 140~ms per edit on consumer GPUs. An editor implementing LDB, incorporating familiar layer concepts, was evaluated via user study and quantitative metrics. Results demonstrate LDB's superior speed alongside comparable or improved image quality, background preservation, and edit fidelity relative to state-of-the-art methods across various sequential image manipulation tasks. The findings highlight LDB's ability to significantly enhance creative workflows by providing an intuitive and efficient approach to diffusion-based image editing and its potential for expansion into related subdomains, such as video editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.00219</p></details> |

We introduce an encoder based iterative inversion technique. The inversion network is conditioned on the input image and the reconstructed image from the previous step, allowing for correction of the next reconstruction towards the input image. We demonstrate that disentangled controls can be easily achieved in the few-step diffusion model by conditioning on an (automatically generated) detailed text prompt. To manipulate the inverted image, we freeze the noise maps and modify one attribute in the text prompt (either manually or via instruction based editing driven by an LLM), resulting in the generation of a new image similar to the input image with only one attribute changed. It can further control the editing strength and accept instructive text prompt. Our approach facilitates realistic text-guided image edits in real-time, requiring only 8 number of functional evaluations (NFEs) in inversion (one-time cost) and 4 NFEs per edit. Our method is not only fast, but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-step diffusion editing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2024.

| **[Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing with Cross Attention Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01626v1)** | 2022-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale text-driven synthesis models have attracted much attention thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images that follow given text prompts. Such text-based synthesis methods are particularly appealing to humans who are used to verbally describe their intent. Therefore, it is only natural to extend the text-driven image synthesis to text-driven image editing. Editing is challenging for these generative models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve most of the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome. State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text only. To this end, we analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this observation, we present several applications which monitor the image synthesis by editing the textual prompt only. This includes localized editing by replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even delicately controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present our results over diverse images and prompts, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[BrushEdit: All-In-One Image Inpainting and Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10316v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>WebPa...</summary><p>WebPage available at https://liyaowei-stu.github.io/project/BrushEdit/</p></details> |
| **[Optimisation-Based Multi-Modal Semantic Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16882v1)** | 2023-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image editing affords increased control over the aesthetics and content of generated images. Pre-existing works focus predominantly on text-based instructions to achieve desired image modifications, which limit edit precision and accuracy. In this work, we propose an inference-time editing optimisation, designed to extend beyond textual edits to accommodate multiple editing instruction types (e.g. spatial layout-based; pose, scribbles, edge maps). We propose to disentangle the editing task into two competing subtasks: successful local image modifications and global content consistency preservation, where subtasks are guided through two dedicated loss functions. By allowing to adjust the influence of each loss function, we build a flexible editing solution that can be adjusted to user preferences. We evaluate our method using text, pose and scribble edit conditions, and highlight our ability to achieve complex edits, through both qualitative and quantitative experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pix2Video: Video Editing using Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12688v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image diffusion models, trained on massive image collections, have emerged as the most versatile image generator model in terms of quality and diversity. They support inverting real images and conditional (e.g., text) generation, making them attractive for high-quality image editing applications. We investigate how to use such pre-trained image models for text-guided video editing. The critical challenge is to achieve the target edits while still preserving the content of the source video. Our method works in two simple steps: first, we use a pre-trained structure-guided (e.g., depth) image diffusion model to perform text-guided edits on an anchor frame; then, in the key step, we progressively propagate the changes to the future frames via self-attention feature injection to adapt the core denoising step of the diffusion model. We then consolidate the changes by adjusting the latent code for the frame before continuing the process. Our approach is training-free and generalizes to a wide range of edits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by extensive experimentation and compare it against four different prior and parallel efforts (on ArXiv). We demonstrate that realistic text-guided video edits are possible, without any compute-intensive preprocessing or video-specific finetuning.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive developments, existing works still face a trade-off between maintaining similarity to the original image and generating content that aligns with the target. Here, we propose KV-Edit, a training-free approach that uses KV cache in DiTs to maintain background consistency, where background tokens are preserved rather than regenerated, eliminating the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training, ultimately generating new content that seamlessly integrates with the background within user-provided regions. We further explore the memory consumption of the KV cache during editing and optimize the space complexity to $O(1)$ using an inversion-free method. Our approach is compatible with any DiT-based generative model without additional training. Experiments demonstrate that KV-Edit significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of both background and image quality, even surpassing training-based methods.

| **[Training-free Editioning of Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17069v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the software industry's practice of offering different editions or versions of a product tailored to specific user groups or use cases, we propose a novel task, namely, training-free editioning, for text-to-image models. Specifically, we aim to create variations of a base text-to-image model without retraining, enabling the model to cater to the diverse needs of different user groups or to offer distinct features and functionalities. To achieve this, we propose that different editions of a given text-to-image model can be formulated as concept subspaces in the latent space of its text encoder (e.g., CLIP). In such a concept subspace, all points satisfy a specific user need (e.g., generating images of a cat lying on the grass/ground/falling leaves). Technically, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to obtain the desired concept subspaces from representative text embedding that correspond to a specific user need or requirement. Projecting the text embedding of a given prompt into these low-dimensional subspaces enables efficient model editioning without retraining. Intuitively, our proposed editioning paradigm enables a service provider to customize the base model into its "cat edition" (or other editions) that restricts image generation to cats, regardless of the user's prompt (e.g., dogs, people, etc.). This introduces a new dimension for product differentiation, targeted functionality, and pricing strategies, unlocking novel business models for text-to-image generators. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach and its potential to enable a wide range of customized text-to-image model editions across various domains and applications.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches have focused on either fine-tuning pre-trained T2I models on specific datasets to generate certain kinds of images (e.g., with a specific object or person), or on optimizing the weights, text prompts, and/or learning features for each input image in an attempt to coax the image generator to produce the desired result. However, these approaches all have shortcomings and fail to produce good results in a predictable and controllable manner. To address this problem, we present TiNO-Edit, an SD-based method that focuses on optimizing the noise patterns and diffusion timesteps during editing, something previously unexplored in the literature. With this simple change, we are able to generate results that both better align with the original images and reflect the desired result. Furthermore, we propose a set of new loss functions that operate in the latent domain of SD, greatly speeding up the optimization when compared to prior approaches, which operate in the pixel domain. Our method can be easily applied to variations of SD including Textual Inversion and DreamBooth that encode new concepts and incorporate them into the edited results. We present a host of image-editing capabilities enabled by our approach.

However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniTune: Text-Driven Image Editing by Fine Tuning a Diffusion Model on a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.09477v4)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven image generation methods have shown impressive results recently, allowing casual users to generate high quality images by providing textual descriptions. However, similar capabilities for editing existing images are still out of reach. Text-driven image editing methods usually need edit masks, struggle with edits that require significant visual changes and cannot easily keep specific details of the edited portion. In this paper we make the observation that image-generation models can be converted to image-editing models simply by fine-tuning them on a single image. We also show that initializing the stochastic sampler with a noised version of the base image before the sampling and interpolating relevant details from the base image after sampling further increase the quality of the edit operation. Combining these observations, we propose UniTune, a novel image editing method. UniTune gets as input an arbitrary image and a textual edit description, and carries out the edit while maintaining high fidelity to the input image. UniTune does not require additional inputs, like masks or sketches, and can perform multiple edits on the same image without retraining. We test our method using the Imagen model in a range of different use cases. We demonstrate that it is broadly applicable and can perform a surprisingly wide range of expressive editing operations, including those requiring significant visual changes that were previously impossible.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2023 |
| **[Explicit Image Caption Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09625v1)** | 2022-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an image and a reference caption, the image caption editing task aims to correct the misalignment errors and generate a refined caption. However, all existing caption editing works are implicit models, ie, they directly produce the refined captions without explicit connections to the reference captions. In this paper, we introduce a new task: Explicit Caption Editing (ECE). ECE models explicitly generate a sequence of edit operations, and this edit operation sequence can translate the reference caption into a refined one. Compared to the implicit editing, ECE has multiple advantages: 1) Explainable: it can trace the whole editing path. 2) Editing Efficient: it only needs to modify a few words. 3) Human-like: it resembles the way that humans perform caption editing, and tries to keep original sentence structures. To solve this new task, we propose the first ECE model: TIger. TIger is a non-autoregressive transformer-based model, consisting of three modules: Tagger_del, Tagger_add, and Inserter. Specifically, Tagger_del decides whether each word should be preserved or not, Tagger_add decides where to add new words, and Inserter predicts the specific word for adding. To further facilitate ECE research, we propose two new ECE benchmarks by re-organizing two existing datasets, dubbed COCO-EE and Flickr30K-EE, respectively. Extensive ablations on both two benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of TIger.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2022, dataset and code are available at https://github.com/baaaad/ECE</p></details> |

However, in computer vision, while text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved generation quality through scaling up, their framework design did not initially consider how to unify with downstream tasks, such as various types of editing. To address this, we introduce DreamOmni, a unified model for image generation and editing. We begin by analyzing existing frameworks and the requirements of downstream tasks, proposing a unified framework that integrates both T2I models and various editing tasks. Furthermore, another key challenge is the efficient creation of high-quality editing data, particularly for instruction-based and drag-based editing. To this end, we develop a synthetic data pipeline using sticker-like elements to synthesize accurate, high-quality datasets efficiently, which enables editing data scaling up for unified model training. For training, DreamOmni jointly trains T2I generation and downstream tasks. T2I training enhances the model's understanding of specific concepts and improves generation quality, while editing training helps the model grasp the nuances of the editing task. This collaboration significantly boosts editing performance. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of DreamOmni. The code and model will be released.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a new image editing method ControlEdit, which transfers clothing image editing to multimodal-guided local inpainting of clothing images. We address the difficulty of collecting real image datasets by leveraging the self-supervised learning approach. Based on this learning approach, we extend the channels of the feature extraction network to ensure consistent clothing image style before and after editing, and we design an inverse latent loss function to achieve soft control over the content of non-edited areas. In addition, we adopt Blended Latent Diffusion as the sampling method to make the editing boundaries transition naturally and enforce consistency of non-edited area content.

However, effective editing requires inverting the source image into a latent space, a process often hindered by prediction errors inherent in DDIM inversion. These errors accumulate during the diffusion process, resulting in inferior content preservation and edit fidelity, especially with conditional inputs. We address these challenges by investigating the primary contributors to error accumulation in DDIM inversion and identify the singularity problem in traditional noise schedules as a key issue. To resolve this, we introduce the Logistic Schedule, a novel noise schedule designed to eliminate singularities, improve inversion stability, and provide a better noise space for image editing. This schedule reduces noise prediction errors, enabling more faithful editing that preserves the original content of the source image. Our approach requires no additional retraining and is compatible with various existing editing methods. Experiments across eight editing tasks demonstrate the Logistic Schedule's superior performance in content preservation and edit fidelity compared to traditional noise schedules, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We train these directions with orthogonality constraints and disentanglement losses. To project images to semantically organized latent spaces, we set an encoder-decoder architecture with attention-based skip connections.

| **[Multi-turn Consistent Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04320v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications, such as interactive photo retouching, artistic content creation, and product design, require flexible and iterative image editing. However, existing image editing methods primarily focus on achieving the desired modifications in a single step, which often struggles with ambiguous user intent, complex transformations, or the need for progressive refinements. As a result, these methods frequently produce inconsistent outcomes or fail to meet user expectations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-turn image editing framework that enables users to iteratively refine their edits, progressively achieving more satisfactory results. Our approach leverages flow matching for accurate image inversion and a dual-objective Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) for stable sampling, effectively mitigating error accumulation. Additionally, by analyzing the layer-wise roles of transformers, we introduce a adaptive attention highlighting method that enhances editability while preserving multi-turn coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves edit success rates and visual fidelity compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMM4Edit: Benchmarking and Evaluating Multimodal Image Editing with LMMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16193v2)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes 1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+ question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner. Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4Edit.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImgEdit: A Unified Image Editing Dataset and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20275v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have enabled high-fidelity text-to-image generation. However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.

| **[LEDITS: Real Image Editing with DDPM Inversion and Semantic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00522v1)** | 2023-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale text-guided diffusion models provide powerful image-generation capabilities. Currently, a significant effort is given to enable the modification of these images using text only as means to offer intuitive and versatile editing. However, editing proves to be difficult for these generative models due to the inherent nature of editing techniques, which involves preserving certain content from the original image. Conversely, in text-based models, even minor modifications to the text prompt frequently result in an entirely distinct result, making attaining one-shot generation that accurately corresponds to the users intent exceedingly challenging. In addition, to edit a real image using these state-of-the-art tools, one must first invert the image into the pre-trained models domain - adding another factor affecting the edit quality, as well as latency. In this exploratory report, we propose LEDITS - a combined lightweight approach for real-image editing, incorporating the Edit Friendly DDPM inversion technique with Semantic Guidance, thus extending Semantic Guidance to real image editing, while harnessing the editing capabilities of DDPM inversion as well. This approach achieves versatile edits, both subtle and extensive as well as alterations in composition and style, while requiring no optimization nor extensions to the architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

In this paper, we present MagicQuill, an integrated image editing system that enables swift actualization of creative ideas. Our system features a streamlined yet functionally robust interface, allowing for the articulation of editing operations (e.g., inserting elements, erasing objects, altering color) with minimal input. These interactions are monitored by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to anticipate editing intentions in real time, bypassing the need for explicit prompt entry. Finally, we apply a powerful diffusion prior, enhanced by a carefully learned two-branch plug-in module, to process editing requests with precise control.

Our key idea is to address the drawbacks in existing image editing datasets like InstructPix2Pix and MagicBrush, and provide a systematic approach to producing massive and high-quality image editing samples. UltraEdit offers several distinct advantages: 1) It features a broader range of editing instructions by leveraging the creativity of large language models (LLMs) alongside in-context editing examples from human raters; 2) Its data sources are based on real images, including photographs and artworks, which provide greater diversity and reduced bias compared to datasets solely generated by text-to-image models; 3) It also supports region-based editing, enhanced by high-quality, automatically produced region annotations. Our experiments show that canonical diffusion-based editing baselines trained on UltraEdit set new records on MagicBrush and Emu-Edit benchmarks. Our analysis further confirms the crucial role of real image anchors and region-based editing data.

To eliminate the need for original underlying data and information to perform chart editing, we propose ChartReformer, a natural language-driven chart image editing solution that directly edits the charts from the input images with the given instruction prompts. The key in this method is that we allow the model to comprehend the chart and reason over the prompt to generate the corresponding underlying data table and visual attributes for new charts, enabling precise edits. Additionally, to generalize ChartReformer, we define and standardize various types of chart editing, covering style, layout, format, and data-centric edits. The experiments show promising results for the natural language-driven chart image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICDAR 2024.

To bridge this gap, we introduce, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed for complex instruction-guided image editing. CompBench features challenging editing scenarios that incorporate fine-grained instruction following, spatial and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling comprehensive evaluation of image editing models' precise manipulation capabilities. To construct CompBench, We propose an MLLM-human collaborative framework with tailored task pipelines. Furthermore, we propose an instruction decoupling strategy that disentangles editing intents into four key dimensions: location, appearance, dynamics, and objects, ensuring closer alignment between instructions and complex editing requirements. Extensive evaluations reveal that CompBench exposes fundamental limitations of current image editing models and provides critical insights for the development of next-generation instruction-guided image editing systems.

| **[Style Transformer for Image Inversion and Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07932v1)** | 2022-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing GAN inversion methods fail to provide latent codes for reliable reconstruction and flexible editing simultaneously. This paper presents a transformer-based image inversion and editing model for pretrained StyleGAN which is not only with less distortions, but also of high quality and flexibility for editing. The proposed model employs a CNN encoder to provide multi-scale image features as keys and values. Meanwhile it regards the style code to be determined for different layers of the generator as queries. It first initializes query tokens as learnable parameters and maps them into W+ space. Then the multi-stage alternate self- and cross-attention are utilized, updating queries with the purpose of inverting the input by the generator. Moreover, based on the inverted code, we investigate the reference- and label-based attribute editing through a pretrained latent classifier, and achieve flexible image-to-image translation with high quality results. Extensive experiments are carried out, showing better performances on both inversion and editing tasks within StyleGAN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2022</p></details> |
| **[Image Inpainting Models are Effective Tools for Instruction-guided Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13139v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This is the technique report for the winning solution of the CVPR2024 GenAI Media Generation Challenge Workshop's Instruction-guided Image Editing track. Instruction-guided image editing has been largely studied in recent years. The most advanced methods, such as SmartEdit and MGIE, usually combine large language models with diffusion models through joint training, where the former provides text understanding ability, and the latter provides image generation ability. However, in our experiments, we find that simply connecting large language models and image generation models through intermediary guidance such as masks instead of joint fine-tuning leads to a better editing performance and success rate. We use a 4-step process IIIE (Inpainting-based Instruction-guided Image Editing): editing category classification, main editing object identification, editing mask acquisition, and image inpainting. Results show that through proper combinations of language models and image inpainting models, our pipeline can reach a high success rate with satisfying visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Instruction Inversion: Image Editing via Visual Prompting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14331v1)** | 2023-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-conditioned image editing has emerged as a powerful tool for editing images. However, in many situations, language can be ambiguous and ineffective in describing specific image edits. When faced with such challenges, visual prompts can be a more informative and intuitive way to convey ideas. We present a method for image editing via visual prompting. Given pairs of example that represent the "before" and "after" images of an edit, our goal is to learn a text-based editing direction that can be used to perform the same edit on new images. We leverage the rich, pretrained editing capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models by inverting visual prompts into editing instructions. Our results show that with just one example pair, we can achieve competitive results compared to state-of-the-art text-conditioned image editing frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://thaoshibe.github.io/visii/</p></details> |
| **[DiffEdit: Diffusion-based semantic image editing with mask guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11427v1)** | 2022-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation has recently seen tremendous advances, with diffusion models allowing to synthesize convincing images for a large variety of text prompts. In this article, we propose DiffEdit, a method to take advantage of text-conditioned diffusion models for the task of semantic image editing, where the goal is to edit an image based on a text query. Semantic image editing is an extension of image generation, with the additional constraint that the generated image should be as similar as possible to a given input image. Current editing methods based on diffusion models usually require to provide a mask, making the task much easier by treating it as a conditional inpainting task. In contrast, our main contribution is able to automatically generate a mask highlighting regions of the input image that need to be edited, by contrasting predictions of a diffusion model conditioned on different text prompts. Moreover, we rely on latent inference to preserve content in those regions of interest and show excellent synergies with mask-based diffusion. DiffEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance on ImageNet. In addition, we evaluate semantic image editing in more challenging settings, using images from the COCO dataset as well as text-based generated images.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Immunizing Images from Text to Image Editing via Adversarial Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10359v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description, without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt. Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while remaining imperceptible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Regular Paper at ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[EditInfinity: Image Editing with Binary-Quantized Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20217v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential. A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion, then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the parameter-efficient adaptation of binary-quantized generative models for image editing, and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose EditInfinity, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our EditInfinity to perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark across `add', `change', and `delete' editing operations, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vincie2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[iEdit: Localised Text-guided Image Editing with Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05947v1)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) can generate realistic images with text guidance using large-scale datasets. However, they demonstrate limited controllability in the output space of the generated images. We propose a novel learning method for text-guided image editing, namely \texttt{iEdit}, that generates images conditioned on a source image and a textual edit prompt. As a fully-annotated dataset with target images does not exist, previous approaches perform subject-specific fine-tuning at test time or adopt contrastive learning without a target image, leading to issues on preserving the fidelity of the source image. We propose to automatically construct a dataset derived from LAION-5B, containing pseudo-target images with their descriptive edit prompts given input image-caption pairs. This dataset gives us the flexibility of introducing a weakly-supervised loss function to generate the pseudo-target image from the latent noise of the source image conditioned on the edit prompt. To encourage localised editing and preserve or modify spatial structures in the image, we propose a loss function that uses segmentation masks to guide the editing during training and optionally at inference. Our model is trained on the constructed dataset with 200K samples and constrained GPU resources. It shows favourable results against its counterparts in terms of image fidelity, CLIP alignment score and qualitatively for editing both generated and real images.</p></details> |  |
| **[OBJECT 3DIT: Language-guided 3D-aware Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11073v1)** | 2023-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image editing tools, while powerful, typically disregard the underlying 3D geometry from which the image is projected. As a result, edits made using these tools may become detached from the geometry and lighting conditions that are at the foundation of the image formation process. In this work, we formulate the newt ask of language-guided 3D-aware editing, where objects in an image should be edited according to a language instruction in context of the underlying 3D scene. To promote progress towards this goal, we release OBJECT: a dataset consisting of 400K editing examples created from procedurally generated 3D scenes. Each example consists of an input image, editing instruction in language, and the edited image. We also introduce 3DIT : single and multi-task models for four editing tasks. Our models show impressive abilities to understand the 3D composition of entire scenes, factoring in surrounding objects, surfaces, lighting conditions, shadows, and physically-plausible object configurations. Surprisingly, training on only synthetic scenes from OBJECT, editing capabilities of 3DIT generalize to real-world images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Reward as Condition for Instruction-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04713v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality training triplets (instruction, original image, edited image) are essential for instruction-based image editing. Predominant training datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing. Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3 perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e., RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. 3) We also build a challenging evaluation benchmark with real-world images/photos and diverse editing instructions, named Real-Edit. Experiments indicate that our multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit. Code is released at https://github.com/bytedance/Multi-Reward-Editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Image Layout Editing with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06419v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great success of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models in image generation and image editing, existing methods still struggle to edit the layout of real images. Although a few works have been proposed to tackle this problem, they either fail to adjust the layout of images, or have difficulty in preserving visual appearance of objects after the layout adjustment. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel image layout editing method that can not only re-arrange a real image to a specified layout, but also can ensure the visual appearance of the objects consistent with their appearance before editing. Concretely, the proposed method consists of two key components. Firstly, a multi-concept learning scheme is used to learn the concepts of different objects from a single image, which is crucial for keeping visual consistency in the layout editing. Secondly, it leverages the semantic consistency within intermediate features of diffusion models to project the appearance information of objects to the desired regions directly. Besides, a novel initialization noise design is adopted to facilitate the process of re-arranging the layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous works in both layout alignment and visual consistency for the task of image layout editing</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural-Driven Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05397v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

In this study, we revisit StyleGANs' hyperspherical prior $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{Z}^+$ and integrate them into seminal GAN inversion methods to improve editing quality. Besides faithful reconstruction, our extensions achieve sophisticated editing quality with the aid of the StyleGAN prior. We project the real images into the proposed space to obtain the inverted codes, by which we then move along $\mathcal{Z}^{+}$, enabling semantic editing without sacrificing image quality. Comprehensive experiments show that $\mathcal{Z}^{+}$ can replace the most commonly-used $\mathcal{W}$, $\mathcal{W}^{+}$, and $\mathcal{S}$ spaces while preserving reconstruction quality, resulting in reduced distortion of edited images.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 9 figures, AI4CC Workshop at CVPR 2023</p></details> |

However, editing existing captions can be easier than generating new ones from scratch. Intuitively, when editing captions, a model is not required to learn information that is already present in the caption (i.e. sentence structure), enabling it to focus on fixing details (e.g. replacing repetitive words). This paper proposes a novel approach to image captioning based on iterative adaptive refinement of an existing caption. Specifically, our caption-editing model consisting of two sub-modules: (1) EditNet, a language module with an adaptive copy mechanism (Copy-LSTM) and a Selective Copy Memory Attention mechanism (SCMA), and (2) DCNet, an LSTM-based denoising auto-encoder. These components enable our model to directly copy from and modify existing captions. Experiments demonstrate that our new approach achieves state-of-art performance on the MS COCO dataset both with and without sequence-level training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2020</p></details> |

However, localized editing in complex scenarios has not been well-studied in the literature, despite its growing real-world demands. Existing mask-based inpainting methods fall short of retaining the underlying structure within the edit region. Meanwhile, mask-free attention-based methods often exhibit editing leakage and misalignment in more complex compositions. In this work, we develop MAG-Edit, a training-free, inference-stage optimization method, which enables localized image editing in complex scenarios. In particular, MAG-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models by maximizing two mask-based cross-attention constraints of the edit token, which in turn gradually enhances the local alignment with the desired prompt. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving both text alignment and structure preservation for localized editing within complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>for p...</summary><p>for project page, see https://mag-edit.github.io/</p></details> |

Recent advancements in GANs include 3D-aware models such as EG3D, which feature efficient triplane-based architectures capable of reconstructing 3D geometry from single images. However, limited attention has been given to providing an integrated framework for 3D-aware, high-quality, reference-based image editing. This study addresses this gap by exploring and demonstrating the effectiveness of the triplane space for advanced reference-based edits. Our novel approach integrates encoding, automatic localization, spatial disentanglement of triplane features, and fusion learning to achieve the desired edits. We demonstrate how our approach excels across diverse domains, including human faces, 360-degree heads, animal faces, partially stylized edits like cartoon faces, full-body clothing edits, and edits on class-agnostic samples.

| **[SINE: Semantic-driven Image-based NeRF Editing with Prior-guided Editing Field](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13277v2)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great success in 2D editing using user-friendly tools, such as Photoshop, semantic strokes, or even text prompts, similar capabilities in 3D areas are still limited, either relying on 3D modeling skills or allowing editing within only a few categories. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-driven NeRF editing approach, which enables users to edit a neural radiance field with a single image, and faithfully delivers edited novel views with high fidelity and multi-view consistency. To achieve this goal, we propose a prior-guided editing field to encode fine-grained geometric and texture editing in 3D space, and develop a series of techniques to aid the editing process, including cyclic constraints with a proxy mesh to facilitate geometric supervision, a color compositing mechanism to stabilize semantic-driven texture editing, and a feature-cluster-based regularization to preserve the irrelevant content unchanged. Extensive experiments and editing examples on both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that our method achieves photo-realistic 3D editing using only a single edited image, pushing the bound of semantic-driven editing in 3D real-world scenes.

| **[ParallelEdits: Efficient Multi-object Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00985v4)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses. In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads. Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Image Editing with Reference Imitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07547v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image editing serves as a practical yet challenging task considering the diverse demands from users, where one of the hardest parts is to precisely describe how the edited image should look like. In this work, we present a new form of editing, termed imitative editing, to help users exercise their creativity more conveniently. Concretely, to edit an image region of interest, users are free to directly draw inspiration from some in-the-wild references (e.g., some relative pictures come across online), without having to cope with the fit between the reference and the source. Such a design requires the system to automatically figure out what to expect from the reference to perform the editing. For this purpose, we propose a generative training framework, dubbed MimicBrush, which randomly selects two frames from a video clip, masks some regions of one frame, and learns to recover the masked regions using the information from the other frame. That way, our model, developed from a diffusion prior, is able to capture the semantic correspondence between separate images in a self-supervised manner. We experimentally show the effectiveness of our method under various test cases as well as its superiority over existing alternatives. We also construct a benchmark to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://xavierchen34.github.io/MimicBrush-Page</p></details> |
| **[Edicho: Consistent Image Editing in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21079v3)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a verified need, consistent editing across in-the-wild images remains a technical challenge arising from various unmanageable factors, like object poses, lighting conditions, and photography environments. Edicho steps in with a training-free solution based on diffusion models, featuring a fundamental design principle of using explicit image correspondence to direct editing. Specifically, the key components include an attention manipulation module and a carefully refined classifier-free guidance (CFG) denoising strategy, both of which take into account the pre-estimated correspondence. Such an inference-time algorithm enjoys a plug-and-play nature and is compatible to most diffusion-based editing methods, such as ControlNet and BrushNet. Extensive results demonstrate the efficacy of Edicho in consistent cross-image editing under diverse settings. We will release the code to facilitate future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ant-research.github.io/edicho/</p></details> |

Current approaches typically comprehend explicit and specific instructions. However, they often exhibit a deficiency in executing active reasoning capacities required to comprehend instructions that are implicit or insufficiently defined. To enhance active reasoning capabilities and impart intelligence to the editing model, we introduce ReasonPix2Pix, a comprehensive reasoning-attentive instruction editing dataset. The dataset is characterized by 1) reasoning instruction, 2) more realistic images from fine-grained categories, and 3) increased variances between input and edited images. When fine-tuned with our dataset under supervised conditions, the model demonstrates superior performance in instructional editing tasks, independent of whether the tasks require reasoning or not. The code will be available at https://github.com/Jin-Ying/ReasonPix2Pix.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstantDrag: Improving Interactivity in Drag-based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08857v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drag-based image editing has recently gained popularity for its interactivity and precision. However, despite the ability of text-to-image models to generate samples within a second, drag editing still lags behind due to the challenge of accurately reflecting user interaction while maintaining image content. Some existing approaches rely on computationally intensive per-image optimization or intricate guidance-based methods, requiring additional inputs such as masks for movable regions and text prompts, thereby compromising the interactivity of the editing process. We introduce InstantDrag, an optimization-free pipeline that enhances interactivity and speed, requiring only an image and a drag instruction as input. InstantDrag consists of two carefully designed networks: a drag-conditioned optical flow generator (FlowGen) and an optical flow-conditioned diffusion model (FlowDiffusion). InstantDrag learns motion dynamics for drag-based image editing in real-world video datasets by decomposing the task into motion generation and motion-conditioned image generation. We demonstrate InstantDrag's capability to perform fast, photo-realistic edits without masks or text prompts through experiments on facial video datasets and general scenes. These results highlight the efficiency of our approach in handling drag-based image editing, making it a promising solution for interactive, real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024.

| **[Image color correction, enhancement, and editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13117v1)** | 2021-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This thesis presents methods and approaches to image color correction, color enhancement, and color editing. To begin, we study the color correction problem from the standpoint of the camera's image signal processor (ISP). A camera's ISP is hardware that applies a series of in-camera image processing and color manipulation steps, many of which are nonlinear in nature, to render the initial sensor image to its final photo-finished representation saved in the 8-bit standard RGB (sRGB) color space. As white balance (WB) is one of the major procedures applied by the ISP for color correction, this thesis presents two different methods for ISP white balancing. Afterward, we discuss another scenario of correcting and editing image colors, where we present a set of methods to correct and edit WB settings for images that have been improperly white-balanced by the ISP. Then, we explore another factor that has a significant impact on the quality of camera-rendered colors, in which we outline two different methods to correct exposure errors in camera-rendered images. Lastly, we discuss post-capture auto color editing and manipulation. In particular, we propose auto image recoloring methods to generate different realistic versions of the same camera-rendered image with new colors. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our methods provide superior solutions compared to existing alternatives targeting color correction, color enhancement, and color editing.</p></details> | PhD dissertation |
| **[SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02370v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, Data and Models are available at: https://github.com/bytedance/SuperEdit</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Text-Guided Single Image Editing for Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05769v4)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence generative content (AIGC) has significantly impacted image generation in the field of remote sensing. However, the equally important area of remote sensing image (RSI) editing has not received sufficient attention. Deep learning based editing methods generally involve two sequential stages: generation and editing. For natural images, these stages primarily rely on generative backbones pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets and text guidance facilitated by vision-language models (VLMs). However, it become less viable for RSIs: First, existing generative RSI benchmark datasets do not fully capture the diversity of RSIs, and is often inadequate for universal editing tasks. Second, the single text semantic corresponds to multiple image semantics, leading to the introduction of incorrect semantics. To solve above problems, this paper proposes a text-guided RSI editing method and can be trained using only a single image. A multi-scale training approach is adopted to preserve consistency without the need for training on extensive benchmarks, while leveraging RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) to ensure accuracy and controllability. Experimental results on multiple RSI editing tasks show that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both CLIP scores and subjective evaluations compared to existing methods. Additionally, we explore the ability of the edited RSIs to support disaster assessment tasks in order to validate their practicality. Codes will be released at https://github.com/HIT-PhilipHan/remote_sensing_image_editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 18 figures, Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[Specify and Edit: Overcoming Ambiguity in Text-Based Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20232v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based editing diffusion models exhibit limited performance when the user's input instruction is ambiguous. To solve this problem, we propose $\textit{Specify ANd Edit}$ (SANE), a zero-shot inference pipeline for diffusion-based editing systems. We use a large language model (LLM) to decompose the input instruction into specific instructions, i.e. well-defined interventions to apply to the input image to satisfy the user's request. We benefit from the LLM-derived instructions along the original one, thanks to a novel denoising guidance strategy specifically designed for the task. Our experiments with three baselines and on two datasets demonstrate the benefits of SANE in all setups. Moreover, our pipeline improves the interpretability of editing models, and boosts the output diversity. We also demonstrate that our approach can be applied to any edit, whether ambiguous or not. Our code is public at https://github.com/fabvio/SANE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Visual Representation for Editing Face Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00522v1)** | 2016-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach for editing face images, which enables numerous exciting applications including face relighting, makeup transfer and face detail editing. Our face edits are based on a visual representation, which includes geometry, face segmentation, albedo, illumination and detail map. To recover our visual representation, we start by estimating geometry using a morphable face model, then decompose the face image to recover the albedo, and then shade the geometry with the albedo and illumination. The residual between our shaded geometry and the input image produces our detail map, which carries high frequency information that is either insufficiently or incorrectly captured by our shading process. By manipulating the detail map, we can edit face images with reality and identity preserved. Our representation allows various applications. First, it allows a user to directly manipulate various illumination. Second, it allows non-parametric makeup transfer with input face's distinctive identity features preserved. Third, it allows non-parametric modifications to the face appearance by transferring details. For face relighting and detail editing, we evaluate via a user study and our method outperforms other methods. For makeup transfer, we evaluate via an online attractiveness evaluation system, and can reliably make people look younger and more attractive. We also show extensive qualitative comparisons to existing methods, and have significant improvements over previous techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Item is Worth a Prompt: Versatile Image Editing with Disentangled Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04880v4)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the success of text-to-image diffusion models (DPMs), image editing is an important application to enable human interaction with AI-generated content. Among various editing methods, editing within the prompt space gains more attention due to its capacity and simplicity of controlling semantics. However, since diffusion models are commonly pretrained on descriptive text captions, direct editing of words in text prompts usually leads to completely different generated images, violating the requirements for image editing. On the other hand, existing editing methods usually consider introducing spatial masks to preserve the identity of unedited regions, which are usually ignored by DPMs and therefore lead to inharmonic editing results. Targeting these two challenges, in this work, we propose to disentangle the comprehensive image-prompt interaction into several item-prompt interactions, with each item linked to a special learned prompt. The resulting framework, named D-Edit, is based on pretrained diffusion models with cross-attention layers disentangled and adopts a two-step optimization to build item-prompt associations. Versatile image editing can then be applied to specific items by manipulating the corresponding prompts. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results in four types of editing operations including image-based, text-based, mask-based editing, and item removal, covering most types of editing applications, all within a single unified framework. Notably, D-Edit is the first framework that can (1) achieve item editing through mask editing and (2) combine image and text-based editing. We demonstrate the quality and versatility of the editing results for a diverse collection of images through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[E4C: Enhance Editability for Text-Based Image Editing by Harnessing Efficient CLIP Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10133v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image editing is a composite process of preserving the source image content and generating new content or applying modifications. While current editing approaches have made improvements under text guidance, most of them have only focused on preserving the information of the input image, disregarding the importance of editability and alignment to the target prompt. In this paper, we prioritize the editability by proposing a zero-shot image editing method, named \textbf{E}nhance \textbf{E}ditability for text-based image \textbf{E}diting via \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{C}LIP guidance (\textbf{E4C}), which only requires inference-stage optimization to explicitly enhance the edibility and text alignment. Specifically, we develop a unified dual-branch feature-sharing pipeline that enables the preservation of the structure or texture of the source image while allowing the other to be adapted based on the editing task. We further integrate CLIP guidance into our pipeline by utilizing our novel random-gateway optimization mechanism to efficiently enhance the semantic alignment with the target prompt. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method effectively resolves the text alignment issues prevalent in existing methods while maintaining the fidelity to the source image, and performs well across a wide range of editing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edit Transfer: Learning Image Editing via Vision In-Context Relations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13327v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new setting, Edit Transfer, where a model learns a transformation from just a single source-target example and applies it to a new query image. While text-based methods excel at semantic manipulations through textual prompts, they often struggle with precise geometric details (e.g., poses and viewpoint changes). Reference-based editing, on the other hand, typically focuses on style or appearance and fails at non-rigid transformations. By explicitly learning the editing transformation from a source-target pair, Edit Transfer mitigates the limitations of both text-only and appearance-centric references. Drawing inspiration from in-context learning in large language models, we propose a visual relation in-context learning paradigm, building upon a DiT-based text-to-image model. We arrange the edited example and the query image into a unified four-panel composite, then apply lightweight LoRA fine-tuning to capture complex spatial transformations from minimal examples. Despite using only 42 training samples, Edit Transfer substantially outperforms state-of-the-art TIE and RIE methods on diverse non-rigid scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of few-shot visual relation learning.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of high-dimensional data, the unconstrained mapping paradigms are not able to properly catch discriminative clues about the corresponding person while drop the misaligned information. Intuitively, the information contained in visual data can be divided into person information (PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each other. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person information, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A surroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to realize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a mutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and multi-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse alignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only accessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES. To properly evaluate our proposed DSSL in the real scenarios, a Real Scenarios Text-based Person Reidentification (RSTPReid) dataset is constructed to benefit future research on text-based person retrieval, which will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'21</p></details> |

Unlike traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR), which focuses solely on ground-view images, TAG-PR introduces greater practical significance and presents unique challenges due to the large viewpoint discrepancy across images. To support this task, we contribute: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset, constructed from public benchmarks with automatically generated textual descriptions, enhanced by a diversified text generation paradigm to ensure robustness under view heterogeneity; and (2) TAG-CLIP, a novel retrieval framework that addresses view heterogeneity through a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific and view-agnostic features and a viewpoint decoupling strategy to decouple view-specific features for better cross-modal alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAG-CLIP on both the proposed TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks.

| **[UP-Person: Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10084v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) as a multi-modal task, which aims to retrieve the target person from a pool of candidate images given a text description, has recently garnered considerable attention due to the progress of contrastive visual-language pre-trained model. Prior works leverage pre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully fine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements compared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model is prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method for Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the multi-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously integrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and Adapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information with task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust global feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are optimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix is proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation of prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla prefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer normalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts caused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art results across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\% parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Yating/UP-Person.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, first submited to IEEE TCSVT on 2024 May.

This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem, we contribute a new benchmark named \textbf{UFineBench} for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly, we construct a new \textbf{dataset} named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions, averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation, we also propose a special \textbf{evaluation paradigm} more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains, cross textual granularity and cross textual styles, named UFine3C, and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability, named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover, we propose CFAM, a more efficient \textbf{algorithm} especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation, CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets, especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore, by evaluating on UFine3C, we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Zplusdragon/UFineBench}.</p></details> |  |

It presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios.

The primary challenge lies in bridging the substantial gap between vision and language modalities, especially when dealing with limited large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a CLIP-based Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (CSKT) approach for TPR. Specifically, to explore the CLIP's knowledge on input side, we first propose a Bidirectional Prompts Transferring (BPT) module constructed by text-to-image and image-to-text bidirectional prompts and coupling projections. Secondly, Dual Adapters Transferring (DAT) is designed to transfer knowledge on output side of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in vision and language. This synergistic two-way collaborative mechanism promotes the early-stage feature fusion and efficiently exploits the existing knowledge of CLIP. CSKT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across three benchmark datasets when the training parameters merely account for 7.4% of the entire model, demonstrating its remarkable efficiency, effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP2024(accepted). minor typos revision compared to version 1 in arxiv</p></details> |

The primary challenge is the intra-class differences, encompassing intra-modal feature variations and cross-modal semantic gaps. Prior works have focused on instance-level samples and ignored prototypical features of each person which are intrinsic and invariant. Toward this, we propose a Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (CPCL) method. In practice, the CPCL introduces the CLIP model to weakly supervised text-based person retrieval to map visual and textual instances into a shared latent space. Subsequently, the proposed Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) module captures associations between heterogeneous modalities of image-text pairs belonging to the same person through the Hybrid Cross-modal Matching (HCM) module in a many-to-many mapping fashion. Moreover, the Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) module further distinguishes valuable outlier samples from each modality, enhancing the creation of more reliable clusters by mining implicit relationships between image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks of weakly supervised text-based person retrieval, which validate the effectiveness, generalizability of CPCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, under peer review</p></details> |
| **[Data Augmentation for Text-based Person Retrieval Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11971v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve person images that match the description given a text query. The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training. However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets. This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR. LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information. In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training. LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR models. Comprehensive experiments on three TPR benchmarks show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAIBC: Capturing All-round Information Beyond Color for Text-based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.05773v1)** | 2022-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a natural language description, text-based person retrieval aims to identify images of a target person from a large-scale person image database. Existing methods generally face a \textbf{color over-reliance problem}, which means that the models rely heavily on color information when matching cross-modal data. Indeed, color information is an important decision-making accordance for retrieval, but the over-reliance on color would distract the model from other key clues (e.g. texture information, structural information, etc.), and thereby lead to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to \textbf{C}apture \textbf{A}ll-round \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}eyond \textbf{C}olor (\textbf{CAIBC}) via a jointly optimized multi-branch architecture for text-based person retrieval. CAIBC contains three branches including an RGB branch, a grayscale (GRS) branch and a color (CLR) branch. Besides, with the aim of making full use of all-round information in a balanced and effective way, a mutual learning mechanism is employed to enable the three branches which attend to varied aspects of information to communicate with and learn from each other. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to evaluate our proposed CAIBC method on the CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets in both \textbf{supervised} and \textbf{weakly supervised} text-based person retrieval settings, which demonstrates that CAIBC significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all the three tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22</p></details> |

As a fundamental task in video surveillance, text-to-image person retrieval aims to retrieve the target person from an image gallery that best matches the given text description. Most existing text-to-image person retrieval methods are trained in a supervised manner that requires sufficient labeled data in the target domain. However, it is common in practice that only unlabeled data is available in the target domain due to the difficulty and cost of data annotation, which limits the generalization of existing methods in practical application scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, termed Graph-Based Cross-Domain Knowledge Distillation (GCKD), to learn the cross-modal feature representation for text-to-image person retrieval in a cross-dataset scenario. The proposed GCKD method consists of two main components. Firstly, a graph-based multi-modal propagation module is designed to bridge the cross-domain correlation among the visual and textual samples. Secondly, a contrastive momentum knowledge distillation module is proposed to learn the cross-modal feature representation using the online knowledge distillation strategy. By jointly optimizing the two modules, the proposed method is able to achieve efficient performance for cross-dataset text-to-image person retrieval. acExtensive experiments on three publicly available text-to-image person retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCKD method, which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[AnomalyLMM: Bridging Generative Knowledge and Discriminative Retrieval for Text-Based Person Anomaly Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04376v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search, this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g., falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1 accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code and models will be released for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimizing the Pretraining Gap: Domain-aligned Text-Based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10195v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements. However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color, and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components, i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain, e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity. Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets, outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/MRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look Before You Leap: Improving Text-based Person Retrieval by Learning A Consistent Cross-modal Common Manifold](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.06209v1)** | 2022-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core problem of text-based person retrieval is how to bridge the heterogeneous gap between multi-modal data. Many previous approaches contrive to learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a \textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When mapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common manifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely invisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus so as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal common manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of the actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal data can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we propose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common Manifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our method, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\textit{san si er hou xing}', namely, to \textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping mechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to CDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the visual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality into C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on two text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05773</p></details> |
| **[See Finer, See More: Implicit Modality Alignment for Text-based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08608v2)** | 2022-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to find the query person based on a textual description. The key is to learn a common latent space mapping between visual-textual modalities. To achieve this goal, existing works employ segmentation to obtain explicitly cross-modal alignments or utilize attention to explore salient alignments. These methods have two shortcomings: 1) Labeling cross-modal alignments are time-consuming. 2) Attention methods can explore salient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs. To relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT) framework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT utilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which contributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained alignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms: multi-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA module explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the BMM module aims to mine \textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and textual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES. Even without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Beat: Bi-directional One-to-Many Embedding Alignment for Text-based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05620v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval (TPR) is a challenging task that involves retrieving a specific individual based on a textual description. Despite considerable efforts to bridge the gap between vision and language, the significant differences between these modalities continue to pose a challenge. Previous methods have attempted to align text and image samples in a modal-shared space, but they face uncertainties in optimization directions due to the movable features of both modalities and the failure to account for one-to-many relationships of image-text pairs in TPR datasets. To address this issue, we propose an effective bi-directional one-to-many embedding paradigm that offers a clear optimization direction for each sample, thus mitigating the optimization problem. Additionally, this embedding scheme generates multiple features for each sample without introducing trainable parameters, making it easier to align with several positive samples. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel Bi-directional one-to-many Embedding Alignment (Beat) model to address the TPR task. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Beat model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular TPR datasets, including CUHK-PEDES (65.61 R@1), ICFG-PEDES (58.25 R@1), and RSTPReID (48.10 R@1). Furthermore, additional experiments on MS-COCO, CUB, and Flowers datasets further demonstrate the potential of Beat to be applied to other image-text retrieval tasks.</p></details> | ACM MM2023 |

Tailoring CLIP to person domain is now a emerging research topic due to the abundant knowledge of vision-language pretraining, but challenges still remain during fine-tuning: (i) Previous full-model fine-tuning in TPR is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.(ii) Existing parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for TPR lacks of fine-grained feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose Domain-Aware Mixture-of-Adapters (DM-Adapter), which unifies Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and PETL to enhance fine-grained feature representations while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, Sparse Mixture-of-Adapters is designed in parallel to MLP layers in both vision and language branches, where different experts specialize in distinct aspects of person knowledge to handle features more finely. To promote the router to exploit domain information effectively and alleviate the routing imbalance, Domain-Aware Router is then developed by building a novel gating function and injecting learnable domain-aware prompts. Extensive experiments show that our DM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study of Validating Synthetic Data for Text-Based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22171v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data plays a pivotal role in Text-Based Person Retrieval (TBPR) research. Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures |
| **[CAMeL: Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18782v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations.

| **[Towards Unified Text-based Person Retrieval: A Large-scale Multi-Attribute and Language Search Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02898v4)** | 2023-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a large Multi-Attribute and Language Search dataset for text-based person retrieval, called MALS, and explore the feasibility of performing pre-training on both attribute recognition and image-text matching tasks in one stone. In particular, MALS contains 1,510,330 image-text pairs, which is about 37.5 times larger than prevailing CUHK-PEDES, and all images are annotated with 27 attributes. Considering the privacy concerns and annotation costs, we leverage the off-the-shelf diffusion models to generate the dataset. To verify the feasibility of learning from the generated data, we develop a new joint Attribute Prompt Learning and Text Matching Learning (APTM) framework, considering the shared knowledge between attribute and text. As the name implies, APTM contains an attribute prompt learning stream and a text matching learning stream. (1) The attribute prompt learning leverages the attribute prompts for image-attribute alignment, which enhances the text matching learning. (2) The text matching learning facilitates the representation learning on fine-grained details, and in turn, boosts the attribute prompt learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the pre-training on MALS, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance via APTM on three challenging real-world benchmarks. In particular, APTM achieves a consistent improvement of +6.96%, +7.68%, and +16.95% Recall@1 accuracy on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets by a clear margin, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prototype-Guided Text-based Person Search based on Rich Chinese Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14834v1)** | 2023-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search aims to simultaneously localize and identify the target person based on query text from uncropped scene images, which can be regarded as the unified task of person detection and text-based person retrieval task. In this work, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset named PRW-TPS-CN based on the widely used person search dataset PRW. Our dataset contains 47,102 sentences, which means there is quite more information than existing dataset. These texts precisely describe the person images from top to bottom, which in line with the natural description order. We also provide both Chinese and English descriptions in our dataset for more comprehensive evaluation. These characteristics make our dataset more applicable. To alleviate the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval, we take advantage of the rich texts in PRW-TPS-CN dataset. We propose to aggregate multiple texts as text prototypes to maintain the prominent text features of a person, which can better reflect the whole character of a person. The overall prototypes lead to generating the image attention map to eliminate the detection misalignment causing the decrease of text-based person retrieval. Thus, the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval is largely alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments on the PRW-TPS-CN dataset. The experimental results show the PRW-TPS-CN dataset's effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset. The TVPReid dataset will be publicly available to benefit future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[Semi-supervised Text-based Person Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18106v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search (TBPS) aims to retrieve images of a specific person from a large image gallery based on a natural language description. Existing methods rely on massive annotated image-text data to achieve satisfactory performance in fully-supervised learning. It poses a significant challenge in practice, as acquiring person images from surveillance videos is relatively easy, while obtaining annotated texts is challenging. The paper undertakes a pioneering initiative to explore TBPS under the semi-supervised setting, where only a limited number of person images are annotated with textual descriptions while the majority of images lack annotations. We present a two-stage basic solution based on generation-then-retrieval for semi-supervised TBPS. The generation stage enriches annotated data by applying an image captioning model to generate pseudo-texts for unannotated images. Later, the retrieval stage performs fully-supervised retrieval learning using the augmented data. Significantly, considering the noise interference of the pseudo-texts on retrieval learning, we propose a noise-robust retrieval framework that enhances the ability of the retrieval model to handle noisy data. The framework integrates two key strategies: Hybrid Patch-Channel Masking (PC-Mask) to refine the model architecture, and Noise-Guided Progressive Training (NP-Train) to enhance the training process. PC-Mask performs masking on the input data at both the patch-level and the channel-level to prevent overfitting noisy supervision. NP-Train introduces a progressive training schedule based on the noise level of pseudo-texts to facilitate noise-robust learning. Extensive experiments on multiple TBPS benchmarks show that the proposed framework achieves promising performance under the semi-supervised setting.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Existing personalization approaches, however, often rely solely on user history to augment the prompt, limiting their effectiveness in generating tailored outputs, especially in cold-start scenarios with sparse data. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PGraphRAG), a framework that leverages user-centric knowledge graphs to enrich personalization. By directly integrating structured user knowledge into the retrieval process and augmenting prompts with user-relevant context, PGraphRAG enhances contextual understanding and output quality. We also introduce the Personalized Graph-based Benchmark for Text Generation, designed to evaluate personalized text generation tasks in real-world settings where user history is sparse or unavailable. Experimental results show that PGraphRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalization methods across diverse tasks, demonstrating the unique advantages of graph-based retrieval for personalization.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are dominated by training models with parallel image-text pairs, which are very costly to collect. In this paper, we make the first attempt to explore TBPS without parallel image-text data ($μ$-TBPS), in which only non-parallel images and texts, or even image-only data, can be adopted. Towards this end, we propose a two-stage framework, generation-then-retrieval (GTR), to first generate the corresponding pseudo text for each image and then perform the retrieval in a supervised manner. In the generation stage, we propose a fine-grained image captioning strategy to obtain an enriched description of the person image, which firstly utilizes a set of instruction prompts to activate the off-the-shelf pretrained vision-language model to capture and generate fine-grained person attributes, and then converts the extracted attributes into a textual description via the finetuned large language model or the hand-crafted template. In the retrieval stage, considering the noise interference of the generated texts for training model, we develop a confidence score-based training scheme by enabling more reliable texts to contribute more during the training. Experimental results on multiple TBPS benchmarks (i.e., CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid) show that the proposed GTR can achieve a promising performance without relying on parallel image-text data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2023</p></details> |

Despite the wide range of applicable areas such as security surveillance, video retrieval, person tracking, and social media analytics, there is a notable absence of comprehensive reviews dedicated to summarizing the text-based person Re-ID from a technical perspective. To address this gap, we propose to introduce a taxonomy spanning Evaluation, Strategy, Architecture, and Optimization dimensions, providing a comprehensive survey of the text-based person Re-ID task. We start by laying the groundwork for text-based person Re-ID, elucidating fundamental concepts related to attribute/natural language-based identification. Then a thorough examination of existing benchmark datasets and metrics is presented. Subsequently, we further delve into prevalent feature extraction strategies employed in text-based person Re-ID research, followed by a concise summary of common network architectures within the domain. Prevalent loss functions utilized for model optimization and modality alignment in text-based person Re-ID are also scrutinized. To conclude, we offer a concise summary of our findings, pinpointing challenges in text-based person Re-ID. In response to these challenges, we outline potential avenues for future open-set text-based person Re-ID and present a baseline architecture for text-based pedestrian image generation-guided re-identification(TBPGR).</p></details> |  |

More specifically, given the description of a person, the goal is to localize the person in an image. To this end, we first construct a benchmark dataset for natural language person retrieval. To do so, we generate bounding boxes for persons in a public image dataset from the segmentation masks, which are then annotated with descriptions and attributes using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. We then adopt a region proposal network in Faster R-CNN as a candidate region generator. The cropped images based on the region proposals as well as the whole images with attention weights are fed into Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction, while the natural language expression and attributes are input to Bidirectional Long Short- Term Memory (BLSTM) models for text feature extraction. The visual and text features are integrated to score region proposals, and the one with the highest score is retrieved as the output of our system. The experimental results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method for generic object retrieval and this line of research promises to benefit search in surveillance video footage.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2017 Workshop (vision meets cognition)</p></details> |

Embedding-based approaches like CLIP enable efficient large-scale retrieval via vector similarity search, but they are primarily trained on literal caption-like text--image pairs and often fail to capture abstract or persona-driven attributes common in product recommendation applications (e.g., ``a gift for a mother who loves gardening''). In contrast, state-of-the-art vision--language models (vLLMs) can align text with images in a flexible manner, but their limited context window prevents them from directly handling retrieval over large catalogs. We propose a framework that distills the preference rankings of a powerful vLLM into an embedding-based system, transferring its nuanced alignment abilities while maintaining the inference-time scalability of an embedding-based approach. Experiments on persona-driven product recommendation tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing embedding-based baselines, providing an efficient solution for personalized text--image retrieval.</p></details> |  |

To close the gap, we study the problem of text-based person search in full images by proposing a new end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimize the pedestrian detection, identification and visual-semantic feature embedding tasks. To take full advantage of the query text, the semantic features are leveraged to instruct the Region Proposal Network to pay more attention to the text-described proposals. Besides, a cross-scale visual-semantic embedding mechanism is utilized to improve the performance. To validate the proposed method, we collect and annotate two large-scale benchmark datasets based on the widely adopted image-based person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets and compared with the baseline methods, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[EERPD: Leveraging Emotion and Emotion Regulation for Improving Personality Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16079v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personality is a fundamental construct in psychology, reflecting an individual's behavior, thinking, and emotional patterns. Previous researches have made some progress in personality detection, primarily by utilizing the whole text to predict personality. However, these studies generally tend to overlook psychological knowledge: they rarely apply the well-established correlations between emotion regulation and personality. Based on this, we propose a new personality detection method called EERPD. This method introduces the use of emotion regulation, a psychological concept highly correlated with personality, for personality prediction. By combining this feature with emotion features, it retrieves few-shot examples and provides process CoTs for inferring labels from text. This approach enhances the understanding of LLM for personality within text and improves the performance in personality detection. Experimental results demonstrate that EERPD significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of personality detection, outperforming previous SOTA by 15.05/4.29 in average F1 on the two benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Visual Representation for Text-based Person Searching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20646v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search aims to retrieve the matched pedestrians from a large-scale image database according to the text description. The core difficulty of this task is how to extract effective details from pedestrian images and texts, and achieve cross-modal alignment in a common latent space. Prior works adopt image and text encoders pre-trained on unimodal data to extract global and local features from image and text respectively, and then global-local alignment is achieved explicitly. However, these approaches still lack the ability of understanding visual details, and the retrieval accuracy is still limited by identity confusion. In order to alleviate the above problems, we rethink the importance of visual features for text-based person search, and propose VFE-TPS, a Visual Feature Enhanced Text-based Person Search model. It introduces a pre-trained multimodal backbone CLIP to learn basic multimodal features and constructs Text Guided Masked Image Modeling task to enhance the model's ability of learning local visual details without explicit annotation. In addition, we design Identity Supervised Global Visual Feature Calibration task to guide the model learn identity-aware global visual features. The key finding of our study is that, with the help of our proposed auxiliary tasks, the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained CLIP model can be successfully adapted to text-based person search task, and the model's visual understanding ability is significantly enhanced. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed model exceeds the existing approaches, and the Rank-1 accuracy is significantly improved with a notable margin of about $1\%\sim9\%$.

We present ProtoMBTI, a cognitively aligned framework for MBTI inference that operationalizes prototype theory within an LLM-based pipeline. First, we construct a balanced, quality-controlled corpus via LLM-guided multi-dimensional augmentation (semantic, linguistic, sentiment). Next, we LoRA-fine-tune a lightweight (<=2B) encoder to learn discriminative embeddings and to standardize a bank of personality prototypes. At inference, we retrieve top-k prototypes for a query post and perform a retrieve--reuse--revise--retain cycle: the model aggregates prototype evidence via prompt-based voting, revises when inconsistencies arise, and, upon correct prediction, retains the sample to continually enrich the prototype library. Across Kaggle and Pandora benchmarks, ProtoMBTI improves over baselines on both the four MBTI dichotomies and the full 16-type task, and exhibits robust cross-dataset generalization. Our results indicate that aligning the inference process with psychological prototype reasoning yields gains in accuracy, interpretability, and transfer for text-based personality modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOBUGraph: Knowledge Graph-Based Retrieval for Enhanced LLM Performance Beyond RAG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05447v3)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is one of the leading and most widely used techniques for enhancing LLM retrieval capabilities, but it still faces significant limitations in commercial use cases. RAG primarily relies on the query-chunk text-to-text similarity in the embedding space for retrieval and can fail to capture deeper semantic relationships across chunks, is highly sensitive to chunking strategies, and is prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose TOBUGraph, a graph-based retrieval framework that first constructs the knowledge graph from unstructured data dynamically and automatically. Using LLMs, TOBUGraph extracts structured knowledge and diverse relationships among data, going beyond RAG's text-to-text similarity. Retrieval is achieved through graph traversal, leveraging the extracted relationships and structures to enhance retrieval accuracy, eliminating the need for chunking configurations while reducing hallucination. We demonstrate TOBUGraph's effectiveness in TOBU, a real-world application in production for personal memory organization and retrieval. Our evaluation using real user data demonstrates that TOBUGraph outperforms multiple RAG implementations in both precision and recall, significantly improving user experience through improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Industry Track</p></details> |

A primary challenge in this task is bridging the substantial representational gap between visual and textual modalities. The prevailing methods map texts and images into unified embedding space for matching, while the intricate semantic correspondences between texts and images are still not effectively constructed. To address this issue, we propose a novel TIPR framework to build fine-grained interactions and alignment between person images and the corresponding texts. Specifically, via fine-tuning the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, a visual-textual dual encoder is firstly constructed, to preliminarily align the image and text features. Secondly, a Text-guided Image Restoration (TIR) auxiliary task is proposed to map abstract textual entities to specific image regions, improving the alignment between local textual and visual embeddings. Additionally, a cross-modal triplet loss is presented to handle hard samples, and further enhance the model's discriminability for minor differences. Moreover, a pruning-based text data augmentation approach is proposed to enhance focus on essential elements in descriptions, thereby avoiding excessive model attention to less significant information. The experimental results show our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three popular benchmark datasets, and the code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/SEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was withdrawn due to a dispute among the authors regarding the content of the article</p></details> |

The significant feature gap between two modalities makes this task very challenging. Many existing methods attempt to utilize local alignment to address this problem in the fine-grained level. However, most relevant methods introduce additional models or complicated training and evaluation strategies, which are hard to use in realistic scenarios. In order to facilitate the practical application, we propose a simple but effective end-to-end learning framework for text-based person search named TIPCB (i.e., Text-Image Part-based Convolutional Baseline). Firstly, a novel dual-path local alignment network structure is proposed to extract visual and textual local representations, in which images are segmented horizontally and texts are aligned adaptively. Then, we propose a multi-stage cross-modal matching strategy, which eliminates the modality gap from three feature levels, including low level, local level and global level. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely-used benchmark dataset (CUHK-PEDES) and verify that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 3.69%, 2.95% and 2.31% in terms of Top-1, Top-5 and Top-10. Our code has been released in https://github.com/OrangeYHChen/TIPCB.</p></details> | 27 pages |

However, in real-world scenarios, such descriptions are often partial or vague. To address this limitation, we introduce a new task called interactive person re-identification (Inter-ReID). Inter-ReID is a dialogue-based retrieval task that iteratively refines initial descriptions through ongoing interactions with the witnesses. To facilitate the study of this new task, we construct a dialogue dataset that incorporates multiple types of questions by decomposing fine-grained attributes of individuals. We further propose LLaVA-ReID, a question model that generates targeted questions based on visual and textual contexts to elicit additional details about the target person. Leveraging a looking-forward strategy, we prioritize the most informative questions as supervision during training. Experimental results on both Inter-ReID and text-based ReID benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-ReID significantly outperforms baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing methods often struggle with part feature extraction and alignment due to the lack of direct part-level supervision and reliance on heuristic features. We propose a novel framework that leverages a part discovery module based on slot attention to autonomously identify and align distinctive parts across modalities, enhancing interpretability and retrieval accuracy without explicit part-level correspondence supervision. Additionally, text-based dynamic part attention adjusts the importance of each part, further improving retrieval outcomes. Our method is evaluated on three public benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-modal Reference Learning for Fine-grained Text-to-Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07718v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained text-to-image retrieval aims to retrieve a fine-grained target image with a given text query. Existing methods typically assume that each training image is accurately depicted by its textual descriptions. However, textual descriptions can be ambiguous and fail to depict discriminative visual details in images, leading to inaccurate representation learning. To alleviate the effects of text ambiguity, we propose a Multi-Modal Reference learning framework to learn robust representations. We first propose a multi-modal reference construction module to aggregate all visual and textual details of the same object into a comprehensive multi-modal reference. The multi-modal reference hence facilitates the subsequent representation learning and retrieval similarity computation. Specifically, a reference-guided representation learning module is proposed to use multi-modal references to learn more accurate visual and textual representations. Additionally, we introduce a reference-based refinement method that employs the object references to compute a reference-based similarity that refines the initial retrieval results. Extensive experiments are conducted on five fine-grained text-to-image retrieval datasets for different text-to-image retrieval tasks. The proposed method has achieved superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on the text-to-person image retrieval dataset RSTPReid, our method achieves the Rank1 accuracy of 56.2\%, surpassing the recent CFine by 5.6\%.</p></details> | TMM25 |
| **[PerSRV: Personalized Sticker Retrieval with Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21801v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instant Messaging is a popular means for daily communication, allowing users to send text and stickers. As the saying goes, "a picture is worth a thousand words", so developing an effective sticker retrieval technique is crucial for enhancing user experience. However, existing sticker retrieval methods rely on labeled data to interpret stickers, and general-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to capture the unique semantics of stickers. Additionally, relevant-based sticker retrieval methods lack personalization, creating a gap between diverse user expectations and retrieval results. To address these, we propose the Personalized Sticker Retrieval with Vision-Language Model framework, namely PerSRV, structured into offline calculations and online processing modules. The online retrieval part follows the paradigm of relevant recall and personalized ranking, supported by the offline pre-calculation parts, which are sticker semantic understanding, utility evaluation and personalization modules. Firstly, for sticker-level semantic understanding, we supervised fine-tuned LLaVA-1.5-7B to generate human-like sticker semantics, complemented by textual content extracted from figures and historical interaction queries. Secondly, we investigate three crowd-sourcing metrics for sticker utility evaluation. Thirdly, we cluster style centroids based on users' historical interactions to achieve personal preference modeling. Finally, we evaluate our proposed PerSRV method on a public sticker retrieval dataset from WeChat, containing 543,098 candidates and 12,568 interactions. Experimental results show that PerSRV significantly outperforms existing methods in multi-modal sticker retrieval. Additionally, our fine-tuned VLM delivers notable improvements in sticker semantic understandings.</p></details> | Accepted at WWW '25 |
| **[Cross-Modal Adaptive Dual Association for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01745v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve images of a person based on a given textual description. The key challenge is to learn the relations between detailed information from visual and textual modalities. Existing works focus on learning a latent space to narrow the modality gap and further build local correspondences between two modalities. However, these methods assume that image-to-text and text-to-image associations are modality-agnostic, resulting in suboptimal associations. In this work, we show the discrepancy between image-to-text association and text-to-image association and propose CADA: Cross-Modal Adaptive Dual Association that finely builds bidirectional image-text detailed associations. Our approach features a decoder-based adaptive dual association module that enables full interaction between visual and textual modalities, allowing for bidirectional and adaptive cross-modal correspondence associations. Specifically, the paper proposes a bidirectional association mechanism: Association of text Tokens to image Patches (ATP) and Association of image Regions to text Attributes (ARA). We adaptively model the ATP based on the fact that aggregating cross-modal features based on mistaken associations will lead to feature distortion. For modeling the ARA, since the attributes are typically the first distinguishing cues of a person, we propose to explore the attribute-level association by predicting the masked text phrase using the related image region. Finally, we learn the dual associations between texts and images, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our dual formulation. Codes will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs + Persona-Plug = Personalized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11901v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalization plays a critical role in numerous language tasks and applications, since users with the same requirements may prefer diverse outputs based on their individual interests. This has led to the development of various personalized approaches aimed at adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate customized outputs aligned with user preferences. Some of them involve fine-tuning a unique personalized LLM for each user, which is too expensive for widespread application. Alternative approaches introduce personalization information in a plug-and-play manner by retrieving the user's relevant historical texts as demonstrations. However, this retrieval-based strategy may break the continuity of the user history and fail to capture the user's overall styles and patterns, hence leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized LLM model, \ours{}. It constructs a user-specific embedding for each individual by modeling all her historical contexts through a lightweight plug-in user embedder module. By attaching this embedding to the task input, LLMs can better understand and capture user habits and preferences, thereby producing more personalized outputs without tuning their own parameters. Extensive experiments on various tasks in the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing personalized LLM approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalize Before Retrieve: LLM-based Personalized Query Expansion for User-Centric Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08935v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice, identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users. This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges, we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Person Text-Image Matching via Text-Feature Interpretability Embedding and External Attack Node Implantation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08657v2)** | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person text-image matching, also known as text based person search, aims to retrieve images of specific pedestrians using text descriptions. Although person text-image matching has made great research progress, existing methods still face two challenges. First, the lack of interpretability of text features makes it challenging to effectively align them with their corresponding image features. Second, the same pedestrian image often corresponds to multiple different text descriptions, and a single text description can correspond to multiple different images of the same identity. The diversity of text descriptions and images makes it difficult for a network to extract robust features that match the two modalities. To address these problems, we propose a person text-image matching method by embedding text-feature interpretability and an external attack node. Specifically, we improve the interpretability of text features by providing them with consistent semantic information with image features to achieve the alignment of text and describe image region features.To address the challenges posed by the diversity of text and the corresponding person images, we treat the variation caused by diversity to features as caused by perturbation information and propose a novel adversarial attack and defense method to solve it. In the model design, graph convolution is used as the basic framework for feature representation and the adversarial attacks caused by text and image diversity on feature extraction is simulated by implanting an additional attack node in the graph convolution layer to improve the robustness of the model against text and image diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of text-pedestrian image matching over existing methods. The source code of the method is published at</p></details> |  |

However, a major challenge lies in the labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic, dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague, incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy, robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference. 13 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Persona-centric Metamorphic Relation guided Robustness Evaluation for Multi-turn Dialogue Modelling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12483v1)** | 2024-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently there has been significant progress in the field of dialogue system thanks to the introduction of training paradigms such as fine-tune and prompt learning. Persona can function as the prior knowledge for maintaining the personality consistency of dialogue systems, which makes it perform well on accuracy. Nonetheless, the conventional reference-based evaluation method falls short in capturing the genuine text comprehension prowess of the model, significantly relying on the quality of data annotation. In contrast, the application of metamorphic testing offers a more profound insight into the model's distinct capabilities without necessitating supplementary annotation labels. This approach furnishes a more comprehensive portrayal of the model's intricacies and exposes intricacies concealed within reference-based validation techniques. Consequently, we introduce a persona-centric metamorphic relation construction for metamorphic testing, aimed at evaluating both the persona consistency and robustness of personalized dialogue models. For that reason, this work evaluates several widely used training paradigms including learning from scratch, pretrain + fine-tune and prompt learning in personalized dialogue retrieval to know if they are more robust or if they have the same flaws as their predecessor. Under three kinds of designed metamorphic relations with consistent outputs, our experimental results reveal that prompt learning shows stronger robustness compared to training from scratch and fine-tune. Although tested retrieval models gain competitively high retrieval accuracy according to the traditional reference-based validation, they are still fragile and demonstrate various unexpected behaviors, thus there is still room for future improvement in personalized dialogue retrieval.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches rely solely on the semantic alignment of queries and arguments, this first shared task on perspective argument retrieval incorporates perspectives during retrieval, accounting for latent influences in argumentation. We present a novel multilingual dataset covering demographic and socio-cultural (socio) variables, such as age, gender, and political attitude, representing minority and majority groups in society. We distinguish between three scenarios to explore how retrieval systems consider explicitly (in both query and corpus) and implicitly (only in query) formulated perspectives. This paper provides an overview of this shared task and summarizes the results of the six submitted systems. We find substantial challenges in incorporating perspectivism, especially when aiming for personalization based solely on the text of arguments without explicitly providing socio profiles. Moreover, retrieval systems tend to be biased towards the majority group but partially mitigate bias for the female gender. While we bootstrap perspective argument retrieval, further research is essential to optimize retrieval systems to facilitate personalization and reduce polarization.</p></details> |  |

While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Features Diffusion Matching, that leverages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Such a cross-modal retrieval task is quite challenging due to significant modality gap, fine-grained differences and insufficiency of annotated data. To better align the two modalities, most existing works focus on introducing sophisticated network structures and auxiliary tasks, which are complex and hard to implement. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective dual Transformer model for text-based person search. By exploiting a hardness-aware contrastive learning strategy, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance without any special design for local feature alignment or side information. Moreover, we propose a proximity data generation (PDG) module to automatically produce more diverse data for cross-modal training. The PDG module first introduces an automatic generation algorithm based on a text-to-image diffusion model, which generates new text-image pair samples in the proximity space of original ones. Then it combines approximate text generation and feature-level mixup during training to further strengthen the data diversity. The PDG module can largely guarantee the reasonability of the generated samples that are directly used for training without any human inspection for noise rejection. It improves the performance of our model significantly, providing a feasible solution to the data insufficiency problem faced by such fine-grained visual-linguistic tasks. Extensive experiments on two popular datasets of the TBPS task (i.e., CUHK-PEDES and ICFG-PEDES) show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches evidently, e.g., improving by 3.88%, 4.02%, 2.92% in terms of Top1, Top5, Top10 on CUHK-PEDES.

Existing ad vanced methods typically depend on vision-language pre trained (VLP) models to facilitate effective cross-modal alignment. However, the inherent constraints of VLP mod-els, which include the global alignment biases and insuffi-cient self-feedback regulation, impede optimal retrieval per formance. In this paper, we propose MeFa, a Multi-Pathway Exploration, Feedback, and Adjustment framework, which deeply explores intrinsic feedback of intra and inter-modal to make targeted adjustment, thereby achieving more precise person-text associations. Specifically, we first design an intra modal reasoning pathway that generates hard negative sam ples for cross-modal data, leveraging feedback from these samples to refine intra-modal reasoning, thereby enhancing sensitivity to subtle discrepancies. Subsequently, we intro duce a cross-modal refinement pathway that utilizes both global information and intermodal feedback to refine local in formation, thus enhancing its global semantic representation. Finally, the discriminative clue correction pathway incorpo rates fine-grained features of secondary similarity as discrim inative clues to further mitigate retrieval failures caused by disparities in these features. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that MeFa achieves superior person retrieval performance without necessitating additional data or complex structures.</p></details> |  |

First, we introduce two Transformer-based backbones to encode robust feature representations of the images and texts. Second, we design a semantic-aligned feature aggregation network to adaptively select and aggregate features with the same semantics into part-aware features, which is achieved by a multi-head attention module constrained by a cross-modality part alignment loss and a diversity loss.

Consequently, lifelog retrieval has emerged as a crucial application. Various studies have explored methods to facilitate rapid access to personal lifelogs for memory recall assistance. In this paper, we propose a Captioning-Integrated Visual Lifelog (CIVIL) Retrieval System for extracting specific images from a user's visual lifelog based on textual queries. Unlike traditional embedding-based methods, our system first generates captions for visual lifelogs and then utilizes a text embedding model to project both the captions and user queries into a shared vector space. Visual lifelogs, captured through wearable cameras, provide a first-person viewpoint, necessitating the interpretation of the activities of the individual behind the camera rather than merely describing the scene. To address this, we introduce three distinct approaches: the single caption method, the collective caption method, and the merged caption method, each designed to interpret the life experiences of lifeloggers. Experimental results show that our method effectively describes first-person visual images, enhancing the outcomes of lifelog retrieval. Furthermore, we construct a textual dataset that converts visual lifelogs into captions, thereby reconstructing personal life experiences.</p></details> |  |

Most previous research has been focused on using either retrieval-based or generation-based methods to develop such systems. Retrieval-based methods have the advantage of returning fluent and informative responses with great diversity. However, the performance of the methods is limited by the size of the response repository. On the other hand, generation-based methods can produce highly coherent responses on any topics. But the generated responses are often generic and not informative due to the lack of grounding knowledge. In this paper, we propose a hybrid neural conversation model that combines the merits of both response retrieval and generation methods. Experimental results on Twitter and Foursquare data show that the proposed model outperforms both retrieval-based methods and generation-based methods (including a recently proposed knowledge-grounded neural conversation model) under both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluation. We hope that the findings in this study provide new insights on how to integrate text retrieval and text generation models for building conversation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Full Paper in CIKM 2019. 10 pages</p></details> |

Extracting visual contents corresponding to the human description is the key to this cross-modal matching problem. Moreover, correlated images and descriptions involve different granularities of semantic relevance, which is usually ignored in previous methods. To exploit the multilevel corresponding visual contents, we propose a pose-guided multi-granularity attention network (PMA). Firstly, we propose a coarse alignment network (CA) to select the related image regions to the global description by a similarity-based attention. To further capture the phrase-related visual body part, a fine-grained alignment network (FA) is proposed, which employs pose information to learn latent semantic alignment between visual body part and textual noun phrase. To verify the effectiveness of our model, we perform extensive experiments on the CUHK Person Description Dataset (CUHK-PEDES) which is currently the only available dataset for text-based person search. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 15 \% in terms of the top-1 metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in AAAI2020(oral)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Identity-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval: a Dataset and a Baseline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21009v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced content-based retrieval methods, notably through models like CLIP that map images and texts into a shared embedding space. However, these methods often struggle with domain-specific entities and long-tail concepts absent from their training data, particularly in identifying specific individuals. In this paper, we explore the task of identity-aware cross-modal retrieval, which aims to retrieve images of persons in specific contexts based on natural language queries. This task is critical in various scenarios, such as for searching and browsing personalized video collections or large audio-visual archives maintained by national broadcasters. We introduce a novel dataset, COCO Person FaceSwap (COCO-PFS), derived from the widely used COCO dataset and enriched with deepfake-generated faces from VGGFace2. This dataset addresses the lack of large-scale datasets needed for training and evaluating models for this task. Our experiments assess the performance of different CLIP variations repurposed for this task, including our architecture, Identity-aware CLIP (Id-CLIP), which achieves competitive retrieval performance through targeted fine-tuning. Our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust cross-modal retrieval systems capable of recognizing long-tail identities and contextual nuances.

| **[Beyond Walking: A Large-Scale Image-Text Benchmark for Text-based Person Anomaly Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17776v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search aims to retrieve specific individuals across camera networks using natural language descriptions. However, current benchmarks often exhibit biases towards common actions like walking or standing, neglecting the critical need for identifying abnormal behaviors in real-world scenarios. To meet such demands, we propose a new task, text-based person anomaly search, locating pedestrians engaged in both routine or anomalous activities via text. To enable the training and evaluation of this new task, we construct a large-scale image-text Pedestrian Anomaly Behavior (PAB) benchmark, featuring a broad spectrum of actions, e.g., running, performing, playing soccer, and the corresponding anomalies, e.g., lying, being hit, and falling of the same identity. The training set of PAB comprises 1,013,605 synthesized image-text pairs of both normalities and anomalies, while the test set includes 1,978 real-world image-text pairs. To validate the potential of PAB, we introduce a cross-modal pose-aware framework, which integrates human pose patterns with identity-based hard negative pair sampling. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmark show that synthetic training data facilitates the fine-grained behavior retrieval, and the proposed pose-aware method arrives at 84.93% recall@1 accuracy, surpassing other competitive methods. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/CMP.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG-based Communication with a Predictive Text Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.05945v4)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several changes occur in the brain in response to voluntary and involuntary activities performed by a person. The ability to retrieve data from the brain within a time space provides a basis for in-depth analyses that offer insight on what changes occur in the brain during its decision-making processes. In this work, we present the technical description and software implementation of an electroencephalographic (EEG) based communication system. We read EEG data in real-time with which we compute the likelihood that a voluntary eye blink has been made by a person and use the decision to trigger buttons on a user interface in order to produce text. Relevant texts are suggested using a modification of the T9 algorithm. Our results indicate that EEG-based technology can be effectively applied in facilitating speech for people with severe speech and muscular disabilities, providing a foundation for future work in the area.</p></details> | Conference paper |
| **[Bridging Queries and Tables through Entities in Table Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06551v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Table retrieval is essential for accessing information stored in structured tabular formats; however, it remains less explored than text retrieval. The content of the table primarily consists of phrases and words, which include a large number of entities, such as time, locations, persons, and organizations. Entities are well-studied in the context of text retrieval, but there is a noticeable lack of research on their applications in table retrieval. In this work, we explore how to leverage entities in tables to improve retrieval performance. First, we investigate the important role of entities in table retrieval from a statistical perspective and propose an entity-enhanced training framework. Subsequently, we use the type of entities to highlight entities instead of introducing an external knowledge base. Moreover, we design an interaction paradigm based on entity representations. Our proposed framework is plug-and-play and flexible, making it easy to integrate into existing table retriever training processes. Empirical results on two table retrieval benchmarks, NQ-TABLES and OTT-QA, show that our proposed framework is both simple and effective in enhancing existing retrievers. We also conduct extensive analyses to confirm the efficacy of different components. Overall, our work provides a promising direction for elevating table retrieval, enlightening future research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Retrieval-Augmentation and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Privacy-Preserving Personalization of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09510v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its substantial impact on various search, recommendation, and question answering tasks, privacy-preserving methods for personalizing large language models (LLMs) have received relatively limited exploration. There is one primary approach in this area through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which generates personalized outputs by enriching the input prompt with information retrieved from the user's personal data. This paper studies an orthogonal approach to RAG that involves learning user-dependent LLM parameters through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents the first systematic study for exploration of PEFT for LLM personalization and provides an extensive comparisons between RAG- and PEFT-based solutions, across a broad set of seven diverse datasets from the LaMP benchmark. Our results demonstrate that, on average, both RAG- and PEFT-based personalization methods yield 14.92% and 1.07% improvements over non-personalized LLMs, respectively. When combining RAG with PEFT, we observe a further improvement of 15.98%, highlighting the effectiveness of their integration in enhancing personalized text generation. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between the amount of user data available and the effectiveness of PEFT. This finding suggests that RAG is particularly beneficial for cold-start users -- users with limited personal data -- while PEFT performs better when more user-specific data is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prototype-guided Cross-modal Completion and Alignment for Incomplete Text-based Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17104v2)** | 2023-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional text-based person re-identification (ReID) techniques heavily rely on fully matched multi-modal data, which is an ideal scenario. However, due to inevitable data missing and corruption during the collection and processing of cross-modal data, the incomplete data issue is usually met in real-world applications. Therefore, we consider a more practical task termed the incomplete text-based ReID task, where person images and text descriptions are not completely matched and contain partially missing modality data. To this end, we propose a novel Prototype-guided Cross-modal Completion and Alignment (PCCA) framework to handle the aforementioned issues for incomplete text-based ReID. Specifically, we cannot directly retrieve person images based on a text query on missing modality data. Therefore, we propose the cross-modal nearest neighbor construction strategy for missing data by computing the cross-modal similarity between existing images and texts, which provides key guidance for the completion of missing modal features. Furthermore, to efficiently complete the missing modal features, we construct the relation graphs with the aforementioned cross-modal nearest neighbor sets of missing modal data and the corresponding prototypes, which can further enhance the generated missing modal features. Additionally, for tighter fine-grained alignment between images and texts, we raise a prototype-aware cross-modal alignment loss that can effectively reduce the modality heterogeneity gap for better fine-grained alignment in common space. Extensive experimental results on several benchmarks with different missing ratios amply demonstrate that our method can consistently outperform state-of-the-art text-image ReID approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sorry...</summary><p>Sorry, some collaborators do not agree to publish it on Arxiv, so please withdraw this paper</p></details> |

In this paper we propose a person retrieval system that uses textual queries (e.g., "black trousers and green shirt") as descriptions and a one-class generative color model with outlier filtering to represent the images both to train the models and to perform the search. The method is evaluated in terms of its efficiency in fulfilling the needs of a forensic retrieval system: limited annotation, robustness, extensibility, adaptability and computational cost. The proposed generative method is compared to a corresponding discriminative approach. Experiments are carried out using a range of queries in three different databases. The experiments show that the two evaluated algorithms provide average retrieval performance and adaptable to new datasets. The proposed generative algorithm has some advantages over the discriminative one, specifically its capability to work with very few training samples and its much lower computational requirements when the number of training examples increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Based Person Search with Limited Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10807v1)** | 2021-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search (TBPS) aims at retrieving a target person from an image gallery with a descriptive text query. Solving such a fine-grained cross-modal retrieval task is challenging, which is further hampered by the lack of large-scale datasets. In this paper, we present a framework with two novel components to handle the problems brought by limited data. Firstly, to fully utilize the existing small-scale benchmarking datasets for more discriminative feature learning, we introduce a cross-modal momentum contrastive learning framework to enrich the training data for a given mini-batch. Secondly, we propose to transfer knowledge learned from existing coarse-grained large-scale datasets containing image-text pairs from drastically different problem domains to compensate for the lack of TBPS training data. A transfer learning method is designed so that useful information can be transferred despite the large domain gap. Armed with these components, our method achieves new state of the art on the CUHK-PEDES dataset with significant improvements over the prior art in terms of Rank-1 and mAP.

This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span. This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy increases along with the level of background knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented a ACL 2025, Main, Long paper</p></details> |

To reduce data collection costs, large-scale text-image datasets are created from co-occurrence pairs found online. However, this can introduce noise, particularly mismatched pairs, which degrade retrieval performance. Existing methods often focus on negative samples, which amplify this noise. To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Uncertainty and Relational Alignment (DURA) framework, which includes the Key Feature Selector (KFS) and a new loss function, Dynamic Softmax Hinge Loss (DSH-Loss). KFS captures and models noise uncertainty, improving retrieval reliability. The bidirectional evidence from cross-modal similarity is modeled as a Dirichlet distribution, enhancing adaptability to noisy data. DSH adjusts the difficulty of negative samples to improve robustness in noisy environments. Our experiments on three datasets show that the method offers strong noise resistance and improves retrieval performance in both low- and high-noise scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often require dedicated backend servers for data storage and retrieval, thereby limiting their applicability in use cases that require strict data privacy, such as personal finance, education, and medicine. To address the pressing need for client-side dense retrieval, we introduce MeMemo, the first open-source JavaScript toolkit that adapts the state-of-the-art approximate nearest neighbor search technique HNSW to browser environments. Developed with modern and native Web technologies, such as IndexedDB and Web Workers, our toolkit leverages client-side hardware capabilities to enable researchers and developers to efficiently search through millions of high-dimensional vectors in the browser.

To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose a brave and new idea of Multi-sentence Video Grounding for Long Video Generation, connecting the massive video moment retrieval to the video generation task for the first time, providing a new paradigm for long video generation. The method of our work can be summarized as three steps: (i) We design sequential scene text prompts as the queries for video grounding, utilizing the massive video moment retrieval to search for video moment segments that meet the text requirements in the video database. (ii) Based on the source frames of retrieved video moment segments, we adopt video editing methods to create new video content while preserving the temporal consistency of the retrieved video. Since the editing can be conducted segment by segment, and even frame by frame, it largely reduces the memory cost. (iii) We also attempt video morphing and personalized generation methods to improve the subject consistency of long video generation, providing ablation experimental results for the subtasks of long video generation. Our approach seamlessly extends the development in image/video editing, video morphing and personalized generation, and video grounding to the long video generation, offering effective solutions for generating long videos at low memory cost.</p></details> |  |

In this task, how to effectively align images and texts globally and locally is a crucial challenge. Recent works have obtained high performances by solving Masked Language Modeling (MLM) to align image/text parts. However, they only performed uni-directional (i.e., from image to text) local-matching, leaving room for improvement by introducing opposite-directional (i.e., from text to image) local-matching. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Local-Matching (BiLMa) framework that jointly optimize MLM and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) in TBPReID model training. With this framework, our model is trained so as the labels of randomly masked both image and text tokens are predicted by unmasked tokens. In addition, to narrow the semantic gap between image and text in MIM, we propose Semantic MIM (SemMIM), in which the labels of masked image tokens are automatically given by a state-of-the-art human parser. Experimental results demonstrate that our BiLMa framework with SemMIM achieves state-of-the-art Rank@1 and mAP scores on three benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCVW 2023</p></details> |

Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Here we look at personalizing a Large Language Model's (LLM) suggestions based on prior conversations to enhance the relevance of predictions, particularly when the user data is small (~1000 samples). Specifically, we compare fine-tuning, prompt-tuning, and retrieval augmented generation of expanded text suggestions for abbreviated inputs. Our case study with a deployed 8B parameter LLM on a real user living with ALS, and experiments on movie character personalization indicates that (1) customization may be necessary in some scenarios and prompt-tuning generalizes well to those, (2) fine-tuning on in-domain data (with as few as 600 samples) still shows some gains, however (3) retrieval augmented few-shot selection also outperforms fine-tuning. (4) Parameter efficient tuning allows for efficient and scalable personalization. For prompt-tuning, we also find that initializing the learned "soft-prompts" to user relevant concept tokens leads to higher accuracy than random initialization.</p></details> |  |

Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, the automatic evaluation of responses generated by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remains an understudied challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new resource for assessing the retrieval effectiveness and relevance of response generated by RAG systems, using a nugget-based evaluation framework. Built upon the foundation of TREC iKAT 2023, our dataset extends to the TREC iKAT 2024 collection, which includes 17 conversations and 20,575 relevance passage assessments, together with 2,279 extracted gold nuggets, and 62 manually written gold answers from NIST assessors. While maintaining the core structure of its predecessor, this new collection enables a deeper exploration of generation tasks in conversational settings. Key improvements in iKAT 2024 include: (1) ``gold nuggets'' -- concise, essential pieces of information extracted from relevant passages of the collection -- which serve as a foundation for automatic response evaluation; (2) manually written answers to provide a gold standard for response evaluation; (3) unanswerable questions to evaluate model hallucination; (4) expanded user personas, providing richer contextual grounding; and (5) a transition from Personal Text Knowledge Base (PTKB) ranking to PTKB classification and selection. Built on this resource, we provide a framework for long-form answer generation evaluation, involving nuggets extraction and nuggets matching, linked to retrieval. This establishes a solid resource for advancing research in personalized conversational search and long-form answer generation.

| **[MARS: Paying more attention to visual attributes for text-based person search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04287v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search (TBPS) is a problem that gained significant interest within the research community. The task is that of retrieving one or more images of a specific individual based on a textual description. The multi-modal nature of the task requires learning representations that bridge text and image data within a shared latent space. Existing TBPS systems face two major challenges. One is defined as inter-identity noise that is due to the inherent vagueness and imprecision of text descriptions and it indicates how descriptions of visual attributes can be generally associated to different people; the other is the intra-identity variations, which are all those nuisances e.g. pose, illumination, that can alter the visual appearance of the same textual attributes for a given subject. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel TBPS architecture named MARS (Mae-Attribute-Relation-Sensitive), which enhances current state-of-the-art models by introducing two key components: a Visual Reconstruction Loss and an Attribute Loss. The former employs a Masked AutoEncoder trained to reconstruct randomly masked image patches with the aid of the textual description. In doing so the model is encouraged to learn more expressive representations and textual-visual relations in the latent space. The Attribute Loss, instead, balances the contribution of different types of attributes, defined as adjective-noun chunks of text. This loss ensures that every attribute is taken into consideration in the person retrieval process. Extensive experiments on three commonly used datasets, namely CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, report performance improvements, with significant gains in the mean Average Precision (mAP) metric w.r.t. the current state of the art.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods typically adopt deep learning-based models, focusing on extracting view-invariant features. However, they usually overlook the semantic information in person attributes. In addition, existing training strategies often rely on full fine-tuning large-scale models, which significantly increases training costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named LATex for AG-ReID, which adopts prompt-tuning strategies to leverage attribute-based text knowledge. Specifically, with the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we first propose an Attribute-aware Image Encoder (AIE) to extract both global semantic features and attribute-aware features from input images. Then, with these features, we propose a Prompted Attribute Classifier Group (PACG) to predict person attributes and obtain attribute representations. Finally, we design a Coupled Prompt Template (CPT) to transform attribute representations and view information into structured sentences. These sentences are processed by the text encoder of CLIP to generate more discriminative features. As a result, our framework can fully leverage attribute-based text knowledge to improve AG-ReID performance. Extensive experiments on three AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/kevinhu314/LATex.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More modifications may be performed</p></details> |
| **[Natural Language Person Search Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00365v1)** | 2018-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in deep reinforcement learning is having an agent learn how to play Go and beat the world champion without any prior knowledge of the game. In that task, the agent has to make a decision on what action to take based on the positions of the pieces. Person Search is recently explored using natural language based text description of images for video surveillance applications (S.Li et.al). We see (Fu.et al) provides an end to end approach for object-based retrieval using deep reinforcement learning without constraints placed on which objects are being detected. However, we believe for real-world applications such as person search defining specific constraints which identify a person as opposed to starting with a general object detection will have benefits in terms of performance and computational resources required. In our task, Deep reinforcement learning would localize the person in an image by reshaping the sizes of the bounding boxes. Deep Reinforcement learning with appropriate constraints would look only for the relevant person in the image as opposed to an unconstrained approach where each individual objects in the image are ranked. For person search, the agent is trying to form a tight bounding box around the person in the image who matches the description. The bounding box is initialized to the full image and at each time step, the agent makes a decision on how to change the current bounding box so that it has a tighter bound around the person based on the description of the person and the pixel values of the current bounding box. After the agent takes an action, it will be given a reward based on the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the current bounding box and the ground truth box. Once the agent believes that the bounding box is covering the person, it will indicate that the person is found.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal Contribution - Work in Progress.

However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR 2025 Industry Track.

| **[Manipulating emotions for ground truth emotion analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08952v1)** | 2020-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text data are being used as a lens through which human cognition can be studied at a large scale. Methods like emotion analysis are now in the standard toolkit of computational social scientists but typically rely on third-person annotation with unknown validity. As an alternative, this paper introduces online emotion induction techniques from experimental behavioural research as a method for text-based emotion analysis. Text data were collected from participants who were randomly allocated to a happy, neutral or sad condition. The findings support the mood induction procedure. We then examined how well lexicon approaches can retrieve the induced emotion. All approaches resulted in statistical differences between the true emotion conditions. Overall, only up to one-third of the variance in emotion was captured by text-based measurements. Pretrained classifiers performed poorly on detecting true emotions. The paper concludes with limitations and suggestions for future research.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic Framework for Robust Text-based Person Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09118v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images, and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score. Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[LAIP: Learning Local Alignment from Image-Phrase Modeling for Text-based Person Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10845v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search aims at retrieving images of a particular person based on a given textual description. A common solution for this task is to directly match the entire images and texts, i.e., global alignment, which fails to deal with discerning specific details that discriminate against appearance-similar people. As a result, some works shift their attention towards local alignment. One group matches fine-grained parts using forward attention weights of the transformer yet underutilizes information. Another implicitly conducts local alignment by reconstructing masked parts based on unmasked context yet with a biased masking strategy. All limit performance improvement. This paper proposes the Local Alignment from Image-Phrase modeling (LAIP) framework, with Bidirectional Attention-weighted local alignment (BidirAtt) and Mask Phrase Modeling (MPM) module.BidirAtt goes beyond the typical forward attention by considering the gradient of the transformer as backward attention, utilizing two-sided information for local alignment. MPM focuses on mask reconstruction within the noun phrase rather than the entire text, ensuring an unbiased masking strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets demonstrate the superiority of the LAIP framework over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Non-Local Alignment over Full-Scale Representation for Text-Based Person Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03036v1)** | 2021-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search aims at retrieving target person in an image gallery using a descriptive sentence of that person. It is very challenging since modal gap makes effectively extracting discriminative features more difficult. Moreover, the inter-class variance of both pedestrian images and descriptions is small. So comprehensive information is needed to align visual and textual clues across all scales. Most existing methods merely consider the local alignment between images and texts within a single scale (e.g. only global scale or only partial scale) then simply construct alignment at each scale separately. To address this problem, we propose a method that is able to adaptively align image and textual features across all scales, called NAFS (i.e.Non-local Alignment over Full-Scale representations). Firstly, a novel staircase network structure is proposed to extract full-scale image features with better locality. Secondly, a BERT with locality-constrained attention is proposed to obtain representations of descriptions at different scales. Then, instead of separately aligning features at each scale, a novel contextual non-local attention mechanism is applied to simultaneously discover latent alignments across all scales. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 5.53% in terms of top-1 and 5.35% in terms of top-5 on text-based person search dataset.

| **[Real-time information retrieval from Identity cards](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12103v1)** | 2020-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information is frequently retrieved from valid personal ID cards by the authorised organisation to address different purposes. The successful information retrieval (IR) depends on the accuracy and timing process. A process which necessitates a long time to respond is frustrating for both sides in the exchange of data. This paper aims to propose a series of state-of-the-art methods for the journey of an Identification card (ID) from the scanning or capture phase to the point before Optical character recognition (OCR). The key factors for this proposal are the accuracy and speed of the process during the journey. The experimental results of this research prove that utilising the methods based on deep learning, such as Efficient and Accurate Scene Text (EAST) detector and Deep Neural Network (DNN) for face detection, instead of traditional methods increase the efficiency considerably.</p></details> | <details><summary>6page...</summary><p>6pages,10 figures,conference</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning for Interactive Recommendation in Fashion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.12033v1)** | 2022-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems and search are both indispensable in facilitating personalization and ease of browsing in online fashion platforms. However, the two tools often operate independently, failing to combine the strengths of recommender systems to accurately capture user tastes with search systems' ability to process user queries. We propose a novel remedy to this problem by automatically recommending personalized fashion items based on a user-provided text request. Our proposed model, WhisperLite, uses contrastive learning to capture user intent from natural language text and improves the recommendation quality of fashion products. WhisperLite combines the strength of CLIP embeddings with additional neural network layers for personalization, and is trained using a composite loss function based on binary cross entropy and contrastive loss. The model demonstrates a significant improvement in offline recommendation retrieval metrics when tested on a real-world dataset collected from an online retail fashion store, as well as widely used open-source datasets in different e-commerce domains, such as restaurants, movies and TV shows, clothing and shoe reviews. We additionally conduct a user study that captures user judgements on the relevance of the model's recommended items, confirming the relevancy of WhisperLite's recommendations in an online setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[PS-ReID: Advancing Person Re-Identification and Precise Segmentation with Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21595v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) plays a critical role in applications such as security surveillance and criminal investigations. Most traditional image-based ReID methods face challenges including occlusions and lighting changes, while text provides complementary information to mitigate these issues. However, the integration of both image and text modalities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose {\bf PS-ReID}, a multimodal model that combines image and text inputs to enhance ReID performance. In contrast to existing ReID methods limited by cropped pedestrian images, our PS-ReID focuses on full-scene settings and introduces a multimodal ReID task that incorporates segmentation, enabling precise feature extraction of the queried individual, even under challenging conditions such as occlusion. To this end, our model adopts a dual-path asymmetric encoding scheme that explicitly separates query and target roles: the query branch captures identity-discriminative cues, while the target branch performs holistic scene reasoning. Additionally, a token-level ReID loss supervises identity-aware tokens, coupling retrieval and segmentation to yield masks that are both spatially precise and identity-consistent. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we construct M2ReID, currently the largest full-scene multimodal ReID dataset, with over 200K images and 4,894 identities, featuring multimodal queries and high-quality segmentation masks. Experimental results demonstrate that PS-ReID significantly outperforms unimodal query-based models in both ReID and segmentation tasks. The model excels in challenging real-world scenarios such as occlusion, low lighting, and background clutter, offering a robust and flexible solution for person retrieval and segmentation. All code, models, and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beating Harmful Stereotypes Through Facts: RAG-based Counter-speech Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12316v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text, and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons, and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library, EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792 texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM) and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refocusing on Relevance: Personalization in NLG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05140v1)** | 2021-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many NLG tasks such as summarization, dialogue response, or open domain question answering focus primarily on a source text in order to generate a target response. This standard approach falls short, however, when a user's intent or context of work is not easily recoverable based solely on that source text -- a scenario that we argue is more of the rule than the exception. In this work, we argue that NLG systems in general should place a much higher level of emphasis on making use of additional context, and suggest that relevance (as used in Information Retrieval) be thought of as a crucial tool for designing user-oriented text-generating tasks. We further discuss possible harms and hazards around such personalization, and argue that value-sensitive design represents a crucial path forward through these challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>was a...</summary><p>was accepted to EMNLP 2021 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Asymmetric Cross-Scale Alignment for Text-Based Person Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.11958v1)** | 2022-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search (TBPS) is of significant importance in intelligent surveillance, which aims to retrieve pedestrian images with high semantic relevance to a given text description. This retrieval task is characterized with both modal heterogeneity and fine-grained matching. To implement this task, one needs to extract multi-scale features from both image and text domains, and then perform the cross-modal alignment. However, most existing approaches only consider the alignment confined at their individual scales, e.g., an image-sentence or a region-phrase scale. Such a strategy adopts the presumable alignment in feature extraction, while overlooking the cross-scale alignment, e.g., image-phrase. In this paper, we present a transformer-based model to extract multi-scale representations, and perform Asymmetric Cross-Scale Alignment (ACSA) to precisely align the two modalities. Specifically, ACSA consists of a global-level alignment module and an asymmetric cross-attention module, where the former aligns an image and texts on a global scale, and the latter applies the cross-attention mechanism to dynamically align the cross-modal entities in region/image-phrase scales. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[PROPEX-RAG: Enhanced GraphRAG using Prompt-Driven Prompt Execution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01802v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a robust framework for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. Recent advances in RAG have investigated graph based retrieval for intricate reasoning; however, the influence of prompt design on enhancing the retrieval and reasoning process is still considerably under-examined. In this paper, we present a prompt-driven GraphRAG framework that underscores the significance of prompt formulation in facilitating entity extraction, fact selection, and passage reranking for multi-hop question answering. Our approach creates a symbolic knowledge graph from text data by encoding entities and factual relationships as structured facts triples. We use LLMs selectively during online retrieval to perform semantic filtering and answer generation. We also use entity-guided graph traversal through Personalized PageRank (PPR) to support efficient, scalable retrieval based on the knowledge graph we built. Our system gets state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA, with F1 scores of 80.7% and 78.9%, and Recall@5 scores of 97.1% and 98.1%, respectively. These results show that prompt design is an important part of improving retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research lays the groundwork for more efficient and comprehensible multi-hop question-answering systems, highlighting the importance of prompt-aware graph reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in PReMI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Foundation Model for Cross-Modal Retrieval and Activity Recognition Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03174v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the widespread adoption of wearable devices has highlighted the growing importance of behavior analysis using IMU. While applications span diverse fields such as healthcare and robotics, recent studies have increasingly focused on multimodal analysis, in addition to unimodal analysis. Several studies have proposed multimodal foundation models that incorporate first-person video and text data; however, these models still fall short in providing a detailed analysis of full-body human activity. To address this limitation, we propose Activity Understanding and Representations Alignment - Multimodal Foundation Model (AURA-MFM), a foundational model integrating four modalities: third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text. By incorporating third-person video and motion capture data, the model enables a detailed and multidimensional understanding of human activity, which first-person perspectives alone fail to capture. Additionally, a Transformer-based IMU encoder is employed to enhance the model's overall performance. Experimental evaluations on retrieval and activity recognition tasks demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods. Notably, in the zero-shot classification for action recognition, our method achieved significantly higher performance, with an F1-score of 0.6226 and an accuracy of 0.7320, whereas the existing method recorded an F1-score of 0.0747 and an accuracy of 0.1961.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |
| **[IDMR: Towards Instance-Driven Precise Visual Correspondence in Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00954v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal retrieval systems are becoming increasingly vital for cutting-edge AI technologies, such as embodied AI and AI-driven digital content industries. However, current multimodal retrieval tasks lack sufficient complexity and demonstrate limited practical application value. It spires us to design Instance-Driven Multimodal Image Retrieval (IDMR), a novel task that requires models to retrieve images containing the same instance as a query image while matching a text-described scenario. Unlike existing retrieval tasks focused on global image similarity or category-level matching, IDMR demands fine-grained instance-level consistency across diverse contexts. To benchmark this capability, we develop IDMR-bench using real-world object tracking and first-person video data. Addressing the scarcity of training data, we propose a cross-domain synthesis method that creates 557K training samples by cropping objects from standard detection datasets. Our Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based retrieval model, trained on 1.2M samples, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on both traditional benchmarks and our zero-shot IDMR-bench. Experimental results demonstrate previous models' limitations in instance-aware retrieval and highlight the potential of MLLM for advanced retrieval applications. The whole training dataset, codes and models, with wide ranges of sizes, are available at https://github.com/BwLiu01/IDMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fashion-RAG: Multimodal Fashion Image Editing via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14011v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the fashion industry has increasingly adopted AI technologies to enhance customer experience, driven by the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and virtual applications. Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.</p></details> | IJCNN 2025 |
| **[TF-CLIP: Learning Text-free CLIP for Video-based Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09627v1)** | 2023-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale language-image pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP) have shown superior performances on many cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, the problem of transferring the knowledge learned from such models to video-based person re-identification (ReID) has barely been explored. In addition, there is a lack of decent text descriptions in current ReID benchmarks. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a novel one-stage text-free CLIP-based learning framework named TF-CLIP for video-based person ReID. More specifically, we extract the identity-specific sequence feature as the CLIP-Memory to replace the text feature. Meanwhile, we design a Sequence-Specific Prompt (SSP) module to update the CLIP-Memory online. To capture temporal information, we further propose a Temporal Memory Diffusion (TMD) module, which consists of two key components: Temporal Memory Construction (TMC) and Memory Diffusion (MD). Technically, TMC allows the frame-level memories in a sequence to communicate with each other, and to extract temporal information based on the relations within the sequence. MD further diffuses the temporal memories to each token in the original features to obtain more robust sequence features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method shows much better results than other state-of-the-art methods on MARS, LS-VID and iLIDS-VID. The code is available at https://github.com/AsuradaYuci/TF-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by AAAI2024</p></details> |

The first methodology leverages Bark, a transformer-based text-to-audio model developed by Suno, and incorporates Meta's enCodec and a pre-trained HuBert model to enhance Bark's performance. The second methodology employs Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion (RVC) and uses the Ozen toolkit for data preparation. Both methodologies contribute to the advancement of ASR technology and offer valuable insights into addressing the challenges of constructing customized Common Voice datasets for under-resourced languages. Furthermore, they provide a pathway to achieving high-quality, personalized voice generation for a range of applications.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenge for the model to recognize personal named entities, such as contacts in a phone book, when the input modality is speech. In this work, we start with a speech recognition task and propose a retrieval-based solution to contextualize the LLM: we first let the LLM detect named entities in speech without any context, then use this named entity as a query to retrieve phonetically similar named entities from a personal database and feed them to the LLM, and finally run context-aware LLM decoding. In a voice assistant task, our solution achieved up to 30.2% relative word error rate reduction and 73.6% relative named entity error rate reduction compared to a baseline system without contextualization. Notably, our solution by design avoids prompting the LLM with the full named entity database, making it highly efficient and applicable to large named entity databases.</p></details> |  |

However, developing effective prompts for desired images can be challenging due to the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. This research proposes PromptMagician, a visual analysis system that helps users explore the image results and refine the input prompts. The backbone of our system is a prompt recommendation model that takes user prompts as input, retrieves similar prompt-image pairs from DiffusionDB, and identifies special (important and relevant) prompt keywords. To facilitate interactive prompt refinement, PromptMagician introduces a multi-level visualization for the cross-modal embedding of the retrieved images and recommended keywords, and supports users in specifying multiple criteria for personalized exploration. Two usage scenarios, a user study, and expert interviews demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system, suggesting it facilitates prompt engineering and improves the creativity support of the generative text-to-image model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted full paper for IEEE VIS 2023</p></details> |

Their social graph is an integral part of this context and is a unique aspect of Facebook search. While embedding-based retrieval (EBR) has been applied in eb search engines for years, Facebook search was still mainly based on a Boolean matching model. In this paper, we discuss the techniques for applying EBR to a Facebook Search system. We introduce the unified embedding framework developed to model semantic embeddings for personalized search, and the system to serve embedding-based retrieval in a typical search system based on an inverted index. We discuss various tricks and experiences on end-to-end optimization of the whole system, including ANN parameter tuning and full-stack optimization. Finally, we present our progress on two selected advanced topics about modeling. We evaluated EBR on verticals for Facebook Search with significant metrics gains observed in online A/B experiments. We believe this paper will provide useful insights and experiences to help people on developing embedding-based retrieval systems in search engines.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, to be published in KDD '20</p></details> |

This task differs from traditional action recognition and localization, where predictions are delivered for all present individuals. In contrast, we focus on recognizing the correct atomic action of a specific individual, guided by text. To explore this task, we present the RefAVA dataset, containing 36,630 instances with manually annotated textual descriptions of the individuals. To establish a strong initial benchmark, we implement and validate baselines from various domains, e.g., atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval. Since these existing methods underperform on RAVAR, we introduce RefAtomNet -- a novel cross-stream attention-driven method specialized for the unique challenges of RAVAR: the need to interpret a textual referring expression for the targeted individual, utilize this reference to guide the spatial localization and harvest the prediction of the atomic actions for the referring person. The key ingredients are: (1) a multi-stream architecture that connects video, text, and a new location-semantic stream, and (2) cross-stream agent attention fusion and agent token fusion which amplify the most relevant information across these streams and consistently surpasses standard attention-based fusion on RAVAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RefAtomNet and its building blocks for recognizing the action of the described individual.

Recognition and identification of demographic traits such as gender, age, location, or personality based on text data can help to improve different marketing strategies. For instance it makes it possible to segment and to personalize offers, thus products and services are exposed to the group of greatest interest. This type of technology has been discussed widely in documents from social media. However, the methods have been poorly studied in data with a more formal structure, where there is no access to emoticons, mentions, and other linguistic phenomena that are only present in social media. This paper proposes the use of recurrent and convolutional neural networks, and a transfer learning strategy for gender recognition in documents that are written in informal and formal languages. Models are tested in two different databases consisting of Tweets and call-center conversations. Accuracies of up to 75\% are achieved for both databases. The results also indicate that it is possible to transfer the knowledge from a system trained on a specific type of expressions or idioms such as those typically used in social media into a more formal type of text data, where the amount of data is more scarce and its structure is completely different.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of CLIP for Text-based Person Search](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10045v2)** | 2023-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve the person images using natural language descriptions. Recently, Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), a universal large cross-modal vision-language pre-training model, has remarkably performed over various cross-modal downstream tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic learning capacity. TPBS, as a fine-grained cross-modal retrieval task, is also facing the rise of research on the CLIP-based TBPS. In order to explore the potential of the visual-language pre-training model for downstream TBPS tasks, this paper makes the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive empirical study of CLIP for TBPS and thus contribute a straightforward, incremental, yet strong TBPS-CLIP baseline to the TBPS community. We revisit critical design considerations under CLIP, including data augmentation and loss function. The model, with the aforementioned designs and practical training tricks, can attain satisfactory performance without any sophisticated modules. Also, we conduct the probing experiments of TBPS-CLIP in model generalization and model compression, demonstrating the effectiveness of TBPS-CLIP from various aspects. This work is expected to provide empirical insights and highlight future CLIP-based TBPS research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2024.

| **[Dual-Path Convolutional Image-Text Embeddings with Instance Loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05535v4)** | 2021-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matching images and sentences demands a fine understanding of both modalities. In this paper, we propose a new system to discriminatively embed the image and text to a shared visual-textual space. In this field, most existing works apply the ranking loss to pull the positive image / text pairs close and push the negative pairs apart from each other. However, directly deploying the ranking loss is hard for network learning, since it starts from the two heterogeneous features to build inter-modal relationship. To address this problem, we propose the instance loss which explicitly considers the intra-modal data distribution. It is based on an unsupervised assumption that each image / text group can be viewed as a class. So the network can learn the fine granularity from every image/text group. The experiment shows that the instance loss offers better weight initialization for the ranking loss, so that more discriminative embeddings can be learned. Besides, existing works usually apply the off-the-shelf features, i.e., word2vec and fixed visual feature. So in a minor contribution, this paper constructs an end-to-end dual-path convolutional network to learn the image and text representations. End-to-end learning allows the system to directly learn from the data and fully utilize the supervision. On two generic retrieval datasets (Flickr30k and MSCOCO), experiments demonstrate that our method yields competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, in language based person retrieval, we improve the state of the art by a large margin. The code has been made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15pages, 15 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

| **[Unsupervised clothing change adaptive person ReID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03702v2)** | 2022-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothing changes and lack of data labels are both crucial challenges in person ReID. For the former challenge, people may occur multiple times at different locations wearing different clothing. However, most of the current person ReID research works focus on the benchmarks in which a person's clothing is kept the same all the time. For the last challenge, some researchers try to make model learn information from a labeled dataset as a source to an unlabeled dataset. Whereas purely unsupervised training is less used. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems at the same time. We design a novel unsupervised model, Sync-Person-Cloud ReID, to solve the unsupervised clothing change person ReID problem. We developer a purely unsupervised clothing change person ReID pipeline with person sync augmentation operation and same person feature restriction. The person sync augmentation is to supply additional same person resources. These same person's resources can be used as part supervised input by same person feature restriction. The extensive experiments on clothing change ReID datasets show the out-performance of our methods.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[OC4-ReID: Occluded Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08557v6)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) focuses on retrieving specific pedestrians when their clothing has changed, typically under the assumption that the entire pedestrian images are visible. Pedestrian images in real-world scenarios, however, are often partially obscured by obstacles, presenting a significant challenge to existing CC-ReID systems. In this paper, we introduce a more challenging task termed Occluded Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (OC4-ReID), which simultaneously addresses two challenges of clothing changes and occlusion. Concretely, we construct two new datasets, Occ-LTCC and Occ-PRCC, based on original CC-ReID datasets to include random occlusions of key pedestrians components (e.g., head, torso). Moreover, a novel benchmark is proposed for OC4-ReID incorporating a Train-Test Micro Granularity Screening (T2MGS) module to mitigate the influence of occlusion and proposing a Part-Robust Triplet (PRT) loss for partial features learning. Comprehensive experiments on the proposed datasets, as well as on two CC-ReID benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of proposed method against other state-of-the-art methods. The codes and datasets are available at: https://github.com/1024AILab/OC4-ReID.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Clothes Changing Person ReID: Conflicts, Synthesis, and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12611v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same person wearing different outfits. Mainstream researches focus on designing advanced model structures and strategies to capture identity information independent of clothing. However, the same-clothes discrimination as the standard ReID learning objective in CC-ReID is persistently ignored in previous researches. In this study, we dive into the relationship between standard and clothes-changing~(CC) learning objectives, and bring the inner conflicts between these two objectives to the fore. We try to magnify the proportion of CC training pairs by supplementing high-fidelity clothes-varying synthesis, produced by our proposed Clothes-Changing Diffusion model. By incorporating the synthetic images into CC-ReID model training, we observe a significant improvement under CC protocol. However, such improvement sacrifices the performance under the standard protocol, caused by the inner conflict between standard and CC. For conflict mitigation, we decouple these objectives and re-formulate CC-ReID learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. By effectively regularizing the gradient curvature across multiple objectives and introducing preference restrictions, our MOO solution surpasses the single-task training paradigm. Our framework is model-agnostic, and demonstrates superior performance under both CC and standard ReID protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEFF: Improving Any Clothes-Changing Person ReID Model using Gallery Enrichment with Face Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13807v2)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) problem, given a query sample of a person, the goal is to determine the correct identity based on a labeled gallery in which the person appears in different clothes. Several models tackle this challenge by extracting clothes-independent features. However, the performance of these models is still lower for the clothes-changing setting compared to the same-clothes setting in which the person appears with the same clothes in the labeled gallery. As clothing-related features are often dominant features in the data, we propose a new process we call Gallery Enrichment, to utilize these features. In this process, we enrich the original gallery by adding to it query samples based on their face features, using an unsupervised algorithm. Additionally, we show that combining ReID and face feature extraction modules alongside an enriched gallery results in a more accurate ReID model, even for query samples with new outfits that do not include faces. Moreover, we claim that existing CC-ReID benchmarks do not fully represent real-world scenarios, and propose a new video CC-ReID dataset called 42Street, based on a theater play that includes crowded scenes and numerous clothes changes. When applied to multiple ReID models, our method (GEFF) achieves an average improvement of 33.5% and 6.7% in the Top-1 clothes-changing metric on the PRCC and LTCC benchmarks. Combined with the latest ReID models, our method achieves new SOTA results on the PRCC, LTCC, CCVID, LaST and VC-Clothes benchmarks and the proposed 42Street dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multigranular Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04527v1)** | 2021-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail. To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task, but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme (MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic information that is used to align the human attributes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Apparel-invariant Feature Learning for Apparel-changed Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06181v2)** | 2020-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of deep learning methods, person Re-Identification (ReID) performance has been improved tremendously in many public datasets. However, most public ReID datasets are collected in a short time window in which persons' appearance rarely changes. In real-world applications such as in a shopping mall, the same person's clothing may change, and different persons may wearing similar clothes. All these cases can result in an inconsistent ReID performance, revealing a critical problem that current ReID models heavily rely on person's apparels. Therefore, it is critical to learn an apparel-invariant person representation under cases like cloth changing or several persons wearing similar clothes. In this work, we tackle this problem from the viewpoint of invariant feature representation learning. The main contributions of this work are as follows. (1) We propose the semi-supervised Apparel-invariant Feature Learning (AIFL) framework to learn an apparel-invariant pedestrian representation using images of the same person wearing different clothes. (2) To obtain images of the same person wearing different clothes, we propose an unsupervised apparel-simulation GAN (AS-GAN) to synthesize cloth changing images according to the target cloth embedding. It's worth noting that the images used in ReID tasks were cropped from real-world low-quality CCTV videos, making it more challenging to synthesize cloth changing images. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets comparing with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposal can improve the ReID performance of the baseline models.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Masked Attribute Description Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05646v3)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to match persons who change clothes over long periods. The key challenge in CC-ReID is to extract clothing-independent features, such as face, hairstyle, body shape, and gait. Current research mainly focuses on modeling body shape using multi-modal biological features (such as silhouettes and sketches). However, it does not fully leverage the personal description information hidden in the original RGB image. Considering that there are certain attribute descriptions which remain unchanged after the changing of cloth, we propose a Masked Attribute Description Embedding (MADE) method that unifies personal visual appearance and attribute description for CC-ReID. Specifically, handling variable clothing-sensitive information, such as color and type, is challenging for effective modeling. To address this, we mask the clothing and color information in the personal attribute description extracted through an attribute detection model. The masked attribute description is then connected and embedded into Transformer blocks at various levels, fusing it with the low-level to high-level features of the image. This approach compels the model to discard clothing information. Experiments are conducted on several CC-ReID benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, Celeb-reID-light, and LaST. Results demonstrate that MADE effectively utilizes attribute description, enhancing cloth-changing person re-identification performance, and compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/moon-wh/MADE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification from A Single Image with Gait Prediction and Regularization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15537v4)** | 2022-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-Changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims at matching the same person across different locations over a long-duration, e.g., over days, and therefore inevitably meets challenge of changing clothing. In this paper, we focus on handling well the CC-ReID problem under a more challenging setting, i.e., just from a single image, which enables high-efficiency and latency-free pedestrian identify for real-time surveillance applications. Specifically, we introduce Gait recognition as an auxiliary task to drive the Image ReID model to learn cloth-agnostic representations by leveraging personal unique and cloth-independent gait information, we name this framework as GI-ReID. GI-ReID adopts a two-stream architecture that consists of a image ReID-Stream and an auxiliary gait recognition stream (Gait-Stream). The Gait-Stream, that is discarded in the inference for high computational efficiency, acts as a regulator to encourage the ReID-Stream to capture cloth-invariant biometric motion features during the training. To get temporal continuous motion cues from a single image, we design a Gait Sequence Prediction (GSP) module for Gait-Stream to enrich gait information. Finally, a high-level semantics consistency over two streams is enforced for effective knowledge regularization. Experiments on multiple image-based Cloth-Changing ReID benchmarks, e.g., LTCC, PRCC, Real28, and VC-Clothes, demonstrate that GI-ReID performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts. Codes are available at https://github.com/jinx-USTC/GI-ReID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2022. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2002.02295 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Shape Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification via 2D-3D Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.18438v1)** | 2023-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) is a common and realistic problem since fashion constantly changes over time and people's aesthetic preferences are not set in stone. While most existing cloth-changing ReID methods focus on learning cloth-agnostic identity representations from coarse semantic cues (e.g. silhouettes and part segmentation maps), they neglect the continuous shape distributions at the pixel level. In this paper, we propose Continuous Surface Correspondence Learning (CSCL), a new shape embedding paradigm for cloth-changing ReID. CSCL establishes continuous correspondences between a 2D image plane and a canonical 3D body surface via pixel-to-vertex classification, which naturally aligns a person image to the surface of a 3D human model and simultaneously obtains pixel-wise surface embeddings. We further extract fine-grained shape features from the learned surface embeddings and then integrate them with global RGB features via a carefully designed cross-modality fusion module. The shape embedding paradigm based on 2D-3D correspondences remarkably enhances the model's global understanding of human body shape. To promote the study of ReID under clothing change, we construct 3D Dense Persons (DP3D), which is the first large-scale cloth-changing ReID dataset that provides densely annotated 2D-3D correspondences and a precise 3D mesh for each person image, while containing diverse cloth-changing cases over all four seasons. Experiments on both cloth-changing and cloth-consistent ReID benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2023</p></details> |
| **[Learning Clothing and Pose Invariant 3D Shape Representation for Long-Term Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10658v3)** | 2023-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-Term Person Re-Identification (LT-ReID) has become increasingly crucial in computer vision and biometrics. In this work, we aim to extend LT-ReID beyond pedestrian recognition to include a wider range of real-world human activities while still accounting for cloth-changing scenarios over large time gaps. This setting poses additional challenges due to the geometric misalignment and appearance ambiguity caused by the diversity of human pose and clothing. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach 3DInvarReID for (i) disentangling identity from non-identity components (pose, clothing shape, and texture) of 3D clothed humans, and (ii) reconstructing accurate 3D clothed body shapes and learning discriminative features of naked body shapes for person ReID in a joint manner. To better evaluate our study of LT-ReID, we collect a real-world dataset called CCDA, which contains a wide variety of human activities and clothing changes. Experimentally, we show the superior performance of our approach for person ReID.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICCV 2023</p></details> |
| **[When Person Re-identification Meets Changing Clothes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04070v3)** | 2020-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) is now an active research topic for AI-based video surveillance applications such as specific person search, but the practical issue that the target person(s) may change clothes (clothes inconsistency problem) has been overlooked for long. For the first time, this paper systematically studies this problem. We first overcome the difficulty of lack of suitable dataset, by collecting a small yet representative real dataset for testing whilst building a large realistic synthetic dataset for training and deeper studies. Facilitated by our new datasets, we are able to conduct various interesting new experiments for studying the influence of clothes inconsistency. We find that changing clothes makes ReID a much harder problem in the sense of bringing difficulties to learning effective representations and also challenges the generalization ability of previous ReID models to identify persons with unseen (new) clothes. Representative existing ReID models are adopted to show informative results on such a challenging setting, and we also provide some preliminary efforts on improving the robustness of existing models on handling the clothes inconsistency issue in the data. We believe that this study can be inspiring and helpful for encouraging more researches in this direction. The dataset is available on the project website: https://wanfb.github.io/dataset.html.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPRW 2020</p></details> |
| **[Features Reconstruction Disentanglement Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10694v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to retrieve specific pedestrians in a cloth-changing scenario. Its main challenge is to disentangle the clothing-related and clothing-unrelated features. Most existing approaches force the model to learn clothing-unrelated features by changing the color of the clothes. However, due to the lack of ground truth, these methods inevitably introduce noise, which destroys the discriminative features and leads to an uncontrollable disentanglement process. In this paper, we propose a new person re-identification network called features reconstruction disentanglement ReID (FRD-ReID), which can controllably decouple the clothing-unrelated and clothing-related features. Specifically, we first introduce the human parsing mask as the ground truth of the reconstruction process. At the same time, we propose the far away attention (FAA) mechanism and the person contour attention (PCA) mechanism for clothing-unrelated features and pedestrian contour features to improve the feature reconstruction efficiency. In the testing phase, we directly discard the clothing-related features for inference,which leads to a controllable disentanglement process. We conducted extensive experiments on the PRCC, LTCC, and Vc-Clothes datasets and demonstrated that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing</p></details> |
| **[Identity-Guided Collaborative Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Reidentification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04400v2)** | 2023-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information), cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clothes-Changing Person Re-identification Based On Skeleton Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10759v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-Changing Person Re-Identification (ReID) aims to recognize the same individual across different videos captured at various times and locations. This task is particularly challenging due to changes in appearance, such as clothing, hairstyle, and accessories. We propose a Clothes-Changing ReID method that uses only skeleton data and does not use appearance features. Traditional ReID methods often depend on appearance features, leading to decreased accuracy when clothing changes. Our approach utilizes a spatio-temporal Graph Convolution Network (GCN) encoder to generate a skeleton-based descriptor for each individual. During testing, we improve accuracy by aggregating predictions from multiple segments of a video clip. Evaluated on the CCVID dataset with several different pose estimation models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a robust and efficient solution for Clothes-Changing ReID.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identity-aware Dual-constraint Network for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08270v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to accurately identify the target person in more realistic surveillance scenarios, where pedestrians usually change their clothing. Despite great progress, limited cloth-changing training samples in existing CC-ReID datasets still prevent the model from adequately learning cloth-irrelevant features. In addition, due to the absence of explicit supervision to keep the model constantly focused on cloth-irrelevant areas, existing methods are still hampered by the disruption of clothing variations. To solve the above issues, we propose an Identity-aware Dual-constraint Network (IDNet) for the CC-ReID task. Specifically, to help the model extract cloth-irrelevant clues, we propose a Clothes Diversity Augmentation (CDA), which generates more realistic cloth-changing samples by enriching the clothing color while preserving the texture. In addition, a Multi-scale Constraint Block (MCB) is designed, which extracts fine-grained identity-related features and effectively transfers cloth-irrelevant knowledge. Moreover, a Counterfactual-guided Attention Module (CAM) is presented, which learns cloth-irrelevant features from channel and space dimensions and utilizes the counterfactual intervention for supervising the attention map to highlight identity-related regions. Finally, a Semantic Alignment Constraint (SAC) is designed to facilitate high-level semantic feature interaction. Comprehensive experiments on four CC-ReID datasets indicate that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Longterm Representations for Person Re-Identification Using Radio Signals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01091v1)** | 2020-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Re-Identification (ReID) aims to recognize a person-of-interest across different places and times. Existing ReID methods rely on images or videos collected using RGB cameras. They extract appearance features like clothes, shoes, hair, etc. Such features, however, can change drastically from one day to the next, leading to inability to identify people over extended time periods. In this paper, we introduce RF-ReID, a novel approach that harnesses radio frequency (RF) signals for longterm person ReID. RF signals traverse clothes and reflect off the human body; thus they can be used to extract more persistent human-identifying features like body size and shape. We evaluate the performance of RF-ReID on longitudinal datasets that span days and weeks, where the person may wear different clothes across days. Our experiments demonstrate that RF-ReID outperforms state-of-the-art RGB-based ReID approaches for long term person ReID. Our results also reveal two interesting features: First since RF signals work in the presence of occlusions and poor lighting, RF-ReID allows for person ReID in such scenarios. Second, unlike photos and videos which reveal personal and private information, RF signals are more privacy-preserving, and hence can help extend person ReID to privacy-concerned domains, like healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2020.

| **[Clothes-Invariant Feature Learning by Causal Intervention for Clothes-Changing Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06145v1)** | 2023-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-invariant feature extraction is critical to the clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). It can provide discriminative identity features and eliminate the negative effects caused by the confounder--clothing changes. But we argue that there exists a strong spurious correlation between clothes and human identity, that restricts the common likelihood-based ReID method P(Y|X) to extract clothes-irrelevant features. In this paper, we propose a new Causal Clothes-Invariant Learning (CCIL) method to achieve clothes-invariant feature learning by modeling causal intervention P(Y|do(X)). This new causality-based model is inherently invariant to the confounder in the causal view, which can achieve the clothes-invariant features and avoid the barrier faced by the likelihood-based methods. Extensive experiments on three CC-ReID benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves a new state of the art.</p></details> |  |

However, the current computer vision community studies specific person re-identification (ReID) tasks in different scenarios separately, which limits the applications in the real world. This paper strives to resolve this problem by proposing a new instruct-ReID task that requires the model to retrieve images according to the given image or language instructions. Our instruct-ReID is a more general ReID setting, where existing 6 ReID tasks can be viewed as special cases by designing different instructions. We propose a large-scale OmniReID benchmark and an adaptive triplet loss as a baseline method to facilitate research in this new setting. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-purpose ReID model, trained on our OmniReID benchmark without fine-tuning, can improve +0.5%, +0.6%, +7.7% mAP on Market1501, MSMT17, CUHK03 for traditional ReID, +6.4%, +7.1%, +11.2% mAP on PRCC, VC-Clothes, LTCC for clothes-changing ReID, +11.7% mAP on COCAS+ real2 for clothes template based clothes-changing ReID when using only RGB images, +24.9% mAP on COCAS+ real2 for our newly defined language-instructed ReID, +4.3% on LLCM for visible-infrared ReID, +2.6% on CUHK-PEDES for text-to-image ReID.

However, due to the high cost of constructing CC-ReID data, the existing data-driven models are hard to train efficiently on limited data, causing overfitting issue. To address this challenge, we propose a low-cost and efficient pipeline for generating controllable and high-quality synthetic data simulating the surveillance of real scenarios specific to the CC-ReID task. Particularly, we construct a new self-annotated CC-ReID dataset named Cloth-Changing Unreal Person (CCUP), containing 6,000 IDs, 1,179,976 images, 100 cameras, and 26.5 outfits per individual. Based on this large-scale dataset, we introduce an effective and scalable pretrain-finetune framework for enhancing the generalization capabilities of the traditional CC-ReID models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that two typical models namely TransReID and FIRe^2, when integrated into our framework, outperform other state-of-the-art models after pretraining on CCUP and finetuning on the benchmarks such as PRCC, VC-Clothes and NKUP.

| **[A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08387v2)** | 2023-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2108.04527</p></details> |
| **[DLCR: A Generative Data Expansion Framework via Diffusion for Clothes-Changing Person Re-ID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07205v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent exhibited strength of generative diffusion models, an open research question is if images generated by these models can be used to learn better visual representations. While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras. Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire. We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and increase their clothing diversity by 10X, totaling over 2.1M images generated. DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features. With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance. On the PRCC dataset, we obtain a large top-1 accuracy improvement of 11.3% by training CAL, a previous state of the art (SOTA) method, with DLCR-generated data. We publicly release our code and generated data for each dataset here: https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/dlcr.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in WACV 2025</p></details> |

Existing unsupervised person re-id methods are mainly designed for short-term scenarios and usually rely on RGB cues so that fail to perceive feature patterns that are independent of the clothes. To crack this bottleneck, we propose a silhouette-driven contrastive learning (SiCL) method, which is designed to learn cross-clothes invariance by integrating both the RGB cues and the silhouette information within a contrastive learning framework. To our knowledge, this is the first tailor-made framework for unsupervised long-term clothes change \reid{}, with superior performance on six benchmark datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed SiCL compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised person reid methods across all the representative datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SiCL significantly outperforms other unsupervised re-id methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for re-ID tend to rely heavily on the assumption that both query and gallery images of the same person have the same clothing. Unfortunately, this assumption may not hold for datasets captured over long periods of time (e.g., weeks, months or years). To tackle the re-ID problem in the context of clothing changes, we propose a novel representation learning model which is able to generate a body shape feature representation without being affected by clothing color or patterns. We call our model the Color Agnostic Shape Extraction Network (CASE-Net). CASE-Net learns a representation of identity that depends only on body shape via adversarial learning and feature disentanglement. Due to the lack of large-scale re-ID datasets which contain clothing changes for the same person, we propose two synthetic datasets for evaluation. We create a rendered dataset SMPL-reID with different clothes patterns and a synthesized dataset Div-Market with different clothing color to simulate two types of clothing changes. The quantitative and qualitative results across 5 datasets (SMPL-reID, Div-Market, two benchmark re-ID datasets, a cross-modality re-ID dataset) confirm the robustness and superiority of our approach against several state-of-the-art approaches</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Identity-Sensitive Knowledge Propagation for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12023v1)** | 2022-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID), which aims to match person identities under clothing changes, is a new rising research topic in recent years. However, typical biometrics-based CC-ReID methods often require cumbersome pose or body part estimators to learn cloth-irrelevant features from human biometric traits, which comes with high computational costs. Besides, the performance is significantly limited due to the resolution degradation of surveillance images. To address the above limitations, we propose an effective Identity-Sensitive Knowledge Propagation framework (DeSKPro) for CC-ReID. Specifically, a Cloth-irrelevant Spatial Attention module is introduced to eliminate the distraction of clothing appearance by acquiring knowledge from the human parsing module. To mitigate the resolution degradation issue and mine identity-sensitive cues from human faces, we propose to restore the missing facial details using prior facial knowledge, which is then propagated to a smaller network. After training, the extra computations for human parsing or face restoration are no longer required. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

To address this, we propose a novel framework called CLIP-Driven Cloth-Agnostic Feature Learning (CCAF) for CC-ReID. Accordingly, two modules were custom-designed: the Invariant Feature Prompting (IFP) and the Clothes Feature Minimization (CFM). These modules guide the model to extract cloth-agnostic features positively and attenuate clothes-related features negatively. Specifically, IFP is designed to extract fine-grained semantic features unrelated to clothes from the raw image, guided by the cloth-agnostic text prompts. This module first covers the clothes in the raw image at the pixel level to obtain the shielding image and then utilizes CLIP's knowledge to generate cloth-agnostic text prompts. Subsequently, it aligns the raw image-text and the raw image-shielding image in the feature space, emphasizing discriminative clues related to identity but unrelated to clothes. Furthermore, CFM is designed to examine and weaken the image encoder's ability to extract clothes features. It first generates text prompts corresponding to clothes pixels. Then, guided by these clothes text prompts, it iteratively examines and disentangles clothes features from pedestrian features, ultimately retaining inherent discriminative features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed CCAF, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on several popular CC-ReID benchmarks without any additional inference time.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in CC-ReID, existing approaches are still hindered by the interference of clothing variations since they lack effective constraints to keep the model consistently focused on clothing-irrelevant regions. To address this issue, we present a Semantic-aware Consistency Network (SCNet) to learn identity-related semantic features by proposing effective consistency constraints. Specifically, we generate the black-clothing image by erasing pixels in the clothing area, which explicitly mitigates the interference from clothing variations. In addition, to fully exploit the fine-grained identity information, a head-enhanced attention module is introduced, which learns soft attention maps by utilizing the proposed part-based matching loss to highlight head information. We further design a semantic consistency loss to facilitate the learning of high-level identity-related semantic features, forcing the model to focus on semantically consistent cloth-irrelevant regions. By using the consistency constraint, our model does not require any extra auxiliary segmentation module to generate the black-clothing image or locate the head region during the inference stage. Extensive experiments on four cloth-changing person Re-ID datasets (LTCC, PRCC, Vc-Clothes, and DeepChange) demonstrate that our proposed SCNet makes significant improvements over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

However, this task faces considerable challenges due to appearance changes caused by clothing alterations. Addressing this issue, this paper proposes an innovative method for disentangled feature extraction, effectively extracting discriminative features from pedestrian images that are invariant to clothing. This method leverages pedestrian parsing techniques to identify and retain features closely associated with individual identity while disregarding the variable nature of clothing attributes. Furthermore, this study introduces a gated channel attention mechanism, which, by adjusting the network's focus, aids the model in more effectively learning and emphasizing features critical for pedestrian identity recognition. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard CC-ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with performance surpassing current leading solutions.

| **[Multiple Information Prompt Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00330v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification is a subject closer to the real world, which focuses on solving the problem of person re-identification after pedestrians change clothes. The primary challenge in this field is to overcome the complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to identify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient data collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this problem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice. Current methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the original image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely limited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional model. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel multiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person ReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance of multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS) module is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB image features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The Bio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning intensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP) module is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the impact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID, Celeb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%, 66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively. When compared to AIM (CVPR23), ACID (TIP23), and SCNet (MM23), MIPL achieves rank-1 improvements of 11.3%, 13.8%, and 7.9%, respectively, on the PRCC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Framework for Multi-scene Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11121v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Re-identification (ReID) has been extensively developed for a decade in order to learn the association of images of the same person across non-overlapping camera views. To overcome significant variations between images across camera views, mountains of variants of ReID models were developed for solving a number of challenges, such as resolution change, clothing change, occlusion, modality change, and so on. Despite the impressive performance of many ReID variants, these variants typically function distinctly and cannot be applied to other challenges. To our best knowledge, there is no versatile ReID model that can handle various ReID challenges at the same time. This work contributes to the first attempt at learning a versatile ReID model to solve such a problem. Our main idea is to form a two-stage prompt-based twin modeling framework called VersReID. Our VersReID firstly leverages the scene label to train a ReID Bank that contains abundant knowledge for handling various scenes, where several groups of scene-specific prompts are used to encode different scene-specific knowledge. In the second stage, we distill a V-Branch model with versatile prompts from the ReID Bank for adaptively solving the ReID of different scenes, eliminating the demand for scene labels during the inference stage. To facilitate training VersReID, we further introduce the multi-scene properties into self-supervised learning of ReID via a multi-scene prioris data augmentation (MPDA) strategy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the success of learning an effective and versatile ReID model for handling ReID tasks under multi-scene conditions without manual assignment of scene labels in the inference stage, including general, low-resolution, clothing change, occlusion, and cross-modality scenes.

Existing methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust, clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in CC-ReID.

| **[DetReIDX: A Stress-Test Dataset for Real-World UAV-Based Person Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04793v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) technology has been considered to perform relatively well under controlled, ground-level conditions, but it breaks down when deployed in challenging real-world settings. Evidently, this is due to extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts. Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location, making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection, tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs conditions. The dataset, annotations, and official evaluation protocols are publicly available at https://www.it.ubi.pt/DetReIDX/</p></details> |  |
| **[TSDW: A Tri-Stream Dynamic Weight Network for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00477v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to solve the challenge of identifying individuals across different temporal-spatial scenarios, viewpoints, and clothing variations. This field is gaining increasing attention in big data research and public security domains. Existing ReID research primarily relies on face recognition, gait semantic recognition, and clothing-irrelevant feature identification, which perform relatively well in scenarios with high-quality clothing change videos and images. However, these approaches depend on either single features or simple combinations of multiple features, making further performance improvements difficult. Additionally, limitations such as missing facial information, challenges in gait extraction, and inconsistent camera parameters restrict the broader application of CC-ReID. To address the above limitations, we innovatively propose a Tri-Stream Dynamic Weight Network (TSDW) that requires only images. This dynamic weighting network consists of three parallel feature streams: facial features, head-limb features, and global features. Each stream specializes in extracting its designated features, after which a gating network dynamically fuses confidence levels. The three parallel feature streams enhance recognition performance and reduce the impact of any single feature failure, thereby improving model robustness. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (e.g., PRCC, Celeb-reID, VC-Clothes) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Disentangled Representation for Robust Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.12003v2)** | 2019-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of person re-identification (reID), that is, retrieving person images from a large dataset, given a query image of the person of interest. A key challenge is to learn person representations robust to intra-class variations, as different persons can have the same attribute and the same person's appearance looks different with viewpoint changes. Recent reID methods focus on learning discriminative features but robust to only a particular factor of variations (e.g., human pose), which requires corresponding supervisory signals (e.g., pose annotations). To tackle this problem, we propose to disentangle identity-related and -unrelated features from person images. Identity-related features contain information useful for specifying a particular person (e.g., clothing), while identity-unrelated ones hold other factors (e.g., human pose, scale changes). To this end, we introduce a new generative adversarial network, dubbed \emph{identity shuffle GAN} (IS-GAN), that factorizes these features using identification labels without any auxiliary information. We also propose an identity-shuffling technique to regularize the disentangled features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IS-GAN, significantly outperforming the state of the art on standard reID benchmarks including the Market-1501, CUHK03 and DukeMTMC-reID.

Existing methods typically mitigate the impact of clothing changes or enhance identity (ID)-relevant features, but they often struggle to capture complex semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework Semantic Contextual Integration (SCI), which leverages the visual-textual representation capabilities of CLIP to reduce clothing-induced discrepancies and strengthen ID cues. Specifically, we introduce the Semantic Separation Enhancement (SSE) module, which employs dual learnable text tokens to disentangle clothing-related semantics from confounding factors, thereby isolating ID-relevant features. Furthermore, we develop a Semantic-Guided Interaction Module (SIM) that uses orthogonalized text features to guide visual representations, sharpening the focus of the model on distinctive ID characteristics. This semantic integration improves the discriminative power of the model and enriches the visual context with high-dimensional insights. Extensive experiments on three CC-ReID datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

In this paper, we empirically and experimentally demonstrate that completely eliminating or fully retaining clothing features is detrimental to the task. Existing work, either relying on clothing labels, silhouettes, or other auxiliary data, fundamentally aim to balance the learning of clothing and identity features. However, we practically find that achieving this balance is challenging and nuanced. In this study, we introduce a novel module called Diverse Norm, which expands personal features into orthogonal spaces and employs channel attention to separate clothing and identity features. A sample re-weighting optimization strategy is also introduced to guarantee the opposite optimization direction. Diverse Norm presents a simple yet effective approach that does not require additional data. Furthermore, Diverse Norm can be seamlessly integrated ResNet50 and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Current CC-ReID approaches either concentrate on modeling body shape using additional modalities including silhouette, pose, and body mesh, potentially causing the model to overlook other critical biometric traits such as gender, age, and style, or they incorporate supervision through additional labels that the model tries to disregard or emphasize, such as clothing or personal attributes. However, these annotations are discrete in nature and do not capture comprehensive descriptions. In this work, we propose DIFFER: Disentangle Identity Features From Entangled Representations, a novel adversarial learning method that leverages textual descriptions to disentangle identity features. Recognizing that image features inherently mix inseparable information, DIFFER introduces NBDetach, a mechanism designed for feature disentanglement by leveraging the separable nature of text descriptions as supervision. It partitions the feature space into distinct subspaces and, through gradient reversal layers, effectively separates identity-related features from non-biometric features. We evaluate DIFFER on 4 different benchmark datasets (LTCC, PRCC, CelebreID-Light, and CCVID) to demonstrate its effectiveness and provide state-of-the-art performance across all the benchmarks. DIFFER consistently outperforms the baseline method, with improvements in top-1 accuracy of 3.6% on LTCC, 3.4% on PRCC, 2.5% on CelebReID-Light, and 1% on CCVID.

Their inherent ambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes them a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of targeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under clothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which is the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly define, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL comprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation (DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent samples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives for effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2) Hard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware optimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic labels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives closer in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability and robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the potential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust CC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the targeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PRCC and LTCC datasets.

| **[Enhancing Long-Term Person Re-Identification Using Global, Local Body Part, and Head Streams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02892v1)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the task of long-term person re-identification. Typically, person re-identification assumes that people do not change their clothes, which limits its applications to short-term scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we investigate long-term person re-identification, which considers both clothes-changing and clothes-consistent scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that effectively learns and utilizes both global and local information. The proposed framework consists of three streams: global, local body part, and head streams. The global and head streams encode identity-relevant information from an entire image and a cropped image of the head region, respectively. Both streams encode the most distinct, less distinct, and average features using the combinations of adversarial erasing, max pooling, and average pooling. The local body part stream extracts identity-related information for each body part, allowing it to be compared with the same body part from another image. Since body part annotations are not available in re-identification datasets, pseudo-labels are generated using clustering. These labels are then utilized to train a body part segmentation head in the local body part stream. The proposed framework is trained by backpropagating the weighted summation of the identity classification loss, the pair-based loss, and the pseudo body part segmentation loss. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments on three publicly available datasets (Celeb-reID, PRCC, and VC-Clothes). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 16 pages |

To our knowledge, MEVID represents the most-varied video person ReID dataset, spanning an extensive indoor and outdoor environment across nine unique dates in a 73-day window, various camera viewpoints, and entity clothing changes. Specifically, we label the identities of 158 unique people wearing 598 outfits taken from 8, 092 tracklets, average length of about 590 frames, seen in 33 camera views from the very large-scale MEVA person activities dataset. While other datasets have more unique identities, MEVID emphasizes a richer set of information about each individual, such as: 4 outfits/identity vs. 2 outfits/identity in CCVID, 33 viewpoints across 17 locations vs. 6 in 5 simulated locations for MTA, and 10 million frames vs. 3 million for LS-VID. Being based on the MEVA video dataset, we also inherit data that is intentionally demographically balanced to the continental United States. To accelerate the annotation process, we developed a semi-automatic annotation framework and GUI that combines state-of-the-art real-time models for object detection, pose estimation, person ReID, and multi-object tracking. We evaluate several state-of-the-art methods on MEVID challenge problems and comprehensively quantify their robustness in terms of changes of outfit, scale, and background location. Our quantitative analysis on the realistic, unique aspects of MEVID shows that there are significant remaining challenges in video person ReID and indicates important directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to WACV 2023</p></details> |

We employ a two-stream network to separately process video understanding and signal analysis tasks, and conduct multi-modal fusion and contrastive learning on pedestrian video and WiFi data. Extensive experiments in real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method effectively uncovers the correlations between heterogeneous data, bridges the gap between visual and signal modalities, significantly expands the sensing range, and improves ReID accuracy across multiple sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Open-World, Diverse, Cross-Spatial-Temporal Benchmark for Dynamic Wild Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15119v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (ReID) has made great strides thanks to the data-driven deep learning techniques. However, the existing benchmark datasets lack diversity, and models trained on these data cannot generalize well to dynamic wild scenarios. To meet the goal of improving the explicit generalization of ReID models, we develop a new Open-World, Diverse, Cross-Spatial-Temporal dataset named OWD with several distinct features. 1) Diverse collection scenes: multiple independent open-world and highly dynamic collecting scenes, including streets, intersections, shopping malls, etc. 2) Diverse lighting variations: long time spans from daytime to nighttime with abundant illumination changes. 3) Diverse person status: multiple camera networks in all seasons with normal/adverse weather conditions and diverse pedestrian appearances (e.g., clothes, personal belongings, poses, etc.). 4) Protected privacy: invisible faces for privacy critical applications. To improve the implicit generalization of ReID, we further propose a Latent Domain Expansion (LDE) method to develop the potential of source data, which decouples discriminative identity-relevant and trustworthy domain-relevant features and implicitly enforces domain-randomized identity feature space expansion with richer domain diversity to facilitate domain invariant representations. Our comprehensive evaluations with most benchmark datasets in the community are crucial for progress, although this work is far from the grand goal toward open-world and dynamic wild applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCV in 2024</p></details> |
| **[Contextualized Multimodal Lifelong Person Re-Identification in Hybrid Clothing States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11247v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person Re-Identification (ReID) has several challenges in real-world surveillance systems due to clothing changes (CCReID) and the need for maintaining continual learning (LReID). Previous existing methods either develop models specifically for one application, which is mostly a same-cloth (SC) setting or treat CCReID as its own separate sub-problem. In this work, we will introduce the LReID-Hybrid task with the goal of developing a model to achieve both SC and CC while learning in a continual setting. Mismatched representations and forgetting from one task to the next are significant issues, we address this with CMLReID, a CLIP-based framework composed of two novel tasks: (1) Context-Aware Semantic Prompt (CASP) that generates adaptive prompts, and also incorporates context to align richly multi-grained visual cues with semantic text space; and (2) Adaptive Knowledge Fusion and Projection (AKFP) which produces robust SC/CC prototypes through the use of a dual-path learner that aligns features with our Clothing-State-Aware Projection Loss. Experiments performed on a wide range of datasets and illustrate that CMLReID outperforms all state-of-the-art methods with strong robustness and generalization despite clothing variations and a sophisticated process of sequential learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Person Re-Identification with Wireless Positioning under Weak Scene Labeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.15610v2)** | 2023-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing unsupervised person re-identification methods only rely on visual clues to match pedestrians under different cameras. Since visual data is essentially susceptible to occlusion, blur, clothing changes, etc., a promising solution is to introduce heterogeneous data to make up for the defect of visual data. Some works based on full-scene labeling introduce wireless positioning to assist cross-domain person re-identification, but their GPS labeling of entire monitoring scenes is laborious. To this end, we propose to explore unsupervised person re-identification with both visual data and wireless positioning trajectories under weak scene labeling, in which we only need to know the locations of the cameras. Specifically, we propose a novel unsupervised multimodal training framework (UMTF), which models the complementarity of visual data and wireless information. Our UMTF contains a multimodal data association strategy (MMDA) and a multimodal graph neural network (MMGN). MMDA explores potential data associations in unlabeled multimodal data, while MMGN propagates multimodal messages in the video graph based on the adjacency matrix learned from histogram statistics of wireless data. Thanks to the robustness of the wireless data to visual noise and the collaboration of various modules, UMTF is capable of learning a model free of the human label on data. Extensive experimental results conducted on two challenging datasets, i.e., WP-ReID and DukeMTMC-VideoReID demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2022</p></details> |

Besides overall visual features, matching and comparing detailed information is also essential for tackling these challenges. This paper proposes two key recognition patterns to better utilize the detail information of pedestrian images, that most of the existing methods are unable to satisfy. Firstly, Visual Clue Alignment requires the model to select and align decisive regions pairs from two images for pair-wise comparison, while existing methods only align regions with predefined rules like high feature similarity or same semantic labels. Secondly, the Conditional Feature Embedding requires the overall feature of a query image to be dynamically adjusted based on the gallery image it matches, while most of the existing methods ignore the reference images. By introducing novel techniques including correspondence attention module and discrepancy-based GCN, we propose an end-to-end ReID method that integrates both patterns into a unified framework, called CACE-Net((C)lue(A)lignment and (C)onditional (E)mbedding). The experiments show that CACE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Size-Variable Virtual Try-On with Physical Clothes Size](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06201v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses a new virtual try-on problem of fitting any size of clothes to a reference person in the image domain. While previous image-based virtual try-on methods can produce highly natural try-on images, these methods fit the clothes on the person without considering the relative relationship between the physical sizes of the clothes and the person. Different from these methods, our method achieves size-variable virtual try-on in which the image size of the try-on clothes is changed depending on this relative relationship of the physical sizes. To relieve the difficulty in maintaining the physical size of the closes while synthesizing the high-fidelity image of the whole clothes, our proposed method focuses on the residual between the silhouettes of the clothes in the reference and try-on images. We also develop a size-variable virtual try-on dataset consisting of 1,524 images provided by 26 subjects. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation metric for size-variable virtual-try-on. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our method can achieve size-variable virtual try-on better than general virtual try-on methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Cross-Attention Network for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15542v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an innovative solution for the challenges of the virtual try-on task: our novel Hierarchical Cross-Attention Network (HCANet). HCANet is crafted with two primary stages: geometric matching and try-on, each playing a crucial role in delivering realistic virtual try-on outcomes. A key feature of HCANet is the incorporation of a novel Hierarchical Cross-Attention (HCA) block into both stages, enabling the effective capture of long-range correlations between individual and clothing modalities. The HCA block enhances the depth and robustness of the network. By adopting a hierarchical approach, it facilitates a nuanced representation of the interaction between the person and clothing, capturing intricate details essential for an authentic virtual try-on experience. Our experiments establish the prowess of HCANet. The results showcase its performance across both quantitative metrics and subjective evaluations of visual realism. HCANet stands out as a state-of-the-art solution, demonstrating its capability to generate virtual try-on results that excel in accuracy and realism. This marks a significant step in advancing virtual try-on technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[VTON-IT: Virtual Try-On using Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04558v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Try-On (trying clothes virtually) is a promising application of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, it is an arduous task to transfer the desired clothing item onto the corresponding regions of a human body because of varying body size, pose, and occlusions like hair and overlapped clothes. In this paper, we try to produce photo-realistic translated images through semantic segmentation and a generative adversarial architecture-based image translation network. We present a novel image-based Virtual Try-On application VTON-IT that takes an RGB image, segments desired body part, and overlays target cloth over the segmented body region. Most state-of-the-art GAN-based Virtual Try-On applications produce unaligned pixelated synthesis images on real-life test images. However, our approach generates high-resolution natural images with detailed textures on such variant images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cloth Interactive Transformer for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05519v2)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2D image-based virtual try-on has aroused increased interest from the multimedia and computer vision fields due to its enormous commercial value. Nevertheless, most existing image-based virtual try-on approaches directly combine the person-identity representation and the in-shop clothing items without taking their mutual correlations into consideration. Moreover, these methods are commonly established on pure convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures which are not simple to capture the long-range correlations among the input pixels. As a result, it generally results in inconsistent results. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage cloth interactive transformer (CIT) method for the virtual try-on task. During the first stage, we design a CIT matching block, aiming to precisely capture the long-range correlations between the cloth-agnostic person information and the in-shop cloth information. Consequently, it makes the warped in-shop clothing items look more natural in appearance. In the second stage, we put forth a CIT reasoning block for establishing global mutual interactive dependencies among person representation, the warped clothing item, and the corresponding warped cloth mask. The empirical results, based on mutual dependencies, demonstrate that the final try-on results are more realistic. Substantial empirical results on a public fashion dataset illustrate that the suggested CIT attains competitive virtual try-on performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, Accepted by ACM ToMM in 2023</p></details> |
| **[Fashion-VDM: Video Diffusion Model for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00225v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Fashion-VDM, a video diffusion model (VDM) for generating virtual try-on videos. Given an input garment image and person video, our method aims to generate a high-quality try-on video of the person wearing the given garment, while preserving the person's identity and motion. Image-based virtual try-on has shown impressive results; however, existing video virtual try-on (VVT) methods are still lacking garment details and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based architecture for video virtual try-on, split classifier-free guidance for increased control over the conditioning inputs, and a progressive temporal training strategy for single-pass 64-frame, 512px video generation. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of joint image-video training for video try-on, especially when video data is limited. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our approach sets the new state-of-the-art for video virtual try-on.

While existing virtual try-on models focus primarily on clothing items, there is a gap in the market for accessories. This research explores the application of techniques from 2D virtual try-on models for clothing, such as VITON-HD, and integrates them with other computer vision models, notably MediaPipe Hand Landmarker. Drawing on existing literature, the study customizes and retrains a unique model using accessory-specific data and network architecture modifications to assess the feasibility of extending virtual try-on technology to accessories. Results demonstrate improved location prediction compared to the original model for clothes, even with a small dataset. This underscores the model's potential with larger datasets exceeding 10,000 images, paving the way for future research in virtual accessory try-on applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Garment DensePose for Robust Warping in Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17688v1)** | 2023-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on, i.e making people virtually try new garments, is an active research area in computer vision with great commercial applications. Current virtual try-on methods usually work in a two-stage pipeline. First, the garment image is warped on the person's pose using a flow estimation network. Then in the second stage, the warped garment is fused with the person image to render a new try-on image. Unfortunately, such methods are heavily dependent on the quality of the garment warping which often fails when dealing with hard poses (e.g., a person lifting or crossing arms). In this work, we propose a robust warping method for virtual try-on based on a learned garment DensePose which has a direct correspondence with the person's DensePose. Due to the lack of annotated data, we show how to leverage an off-the-shelf person DensePose model and a pretrained flow model to learn the garment DensePose in a weakly supervised manner. The garment DensePose allows a robust warping to any person's pose without any additional computation. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art equivalent on virtual try-on benchmarks and shows warping robustness on in-the-wild person images with hard poses, making it more suited for real-world virtual try-on applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Disentangled Cycle Consistency for Highly-realistic Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09479v2)** | 2021-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image virtual try-on replaces the clothes on a person image with a desired in-shop clothes image. It is challenging because the person and the in-shop clothes are unpaired. Existing methods formulate virtual try-on as either in-painting or cycle consistency. Both of these two formulations encourage the generation networks to reconstruct the input image in a self-supervised manner. However, existing methods do not differentiate clothing and non-clothing regions. A straight-forward generation impedes virtual try-on quality because of the heavily coupled image contents. In this paper, we propose a Disentangled Cycle-consistency Try-On Network (DCTON). The DCTON is able to produce highly-realistic try-on images by disentangling important components of virtual try-on including clothes warping, skin synthesis, and image composition. To this end, DCTON can be naturally trained in a self-supervised manner following cycle consistency learning. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that DCTON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches favorably.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2021 |

However, there is a gap between current research progress and commercial applications and an absence of comprehensive overview of this field to accelerate the development.In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies in aspects of pipeline architecture, person representation and key modules such as try-on indication, clothing warping and try-on stage. We additionally apply CLIP to assess the semantic alignment of try-on results, and evaluate representative methods with uniformly implemented evaluation metrics on the same dataset.In addition to quantitative and qualitative evaluation of current open-source methods, unresolved issues are highlighted and future research directions are prospected to identify key trends and inspire further exploration.

However, limited work has explored the task of video-based virtual try-on while it is important in real-world applications. Most existing video-based virtual try-on methods usually require clothing templates and they can only generate blurred and low-resolution results. To address these challenges, we propose a Memory-based Video virtual Try-On Network (MV-TON), which seamlessly transfers desired clothes to a target person without using any clothing templates and generates high-resolution realistic videos. Specifically, MV-TON consists of two modules: 1) a try-on module that transfers the desired clothes from model images to frame images by pose alignment and region-wise replacing of pixels; 2) a memory refinement module that learns to embed the existing generated frames into the latent space as external memory for the following frame generation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in the video virtual try-on task and its superiority over other existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voost: A Unified and Scalable Diffusion Transformer for Bidirectional Virtual Try-On and Try-Off](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04825v2)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on aims to synthesize a realistic image of a person wearing a target garment, but accurately modeling garment-body correspondence remains a persistent challenge, especially under pose and appearance variation. In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025, project page: https://nxnai.github.io/Voost/</p></details> |
| **[Shape Controllable Virtual Try-on for Underwear Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13156v1)** | 2021-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image virtual try-on task has abundant applications and has become a hot research topic recently. Existing 2D image-based virtual try-on methods aim to transfer a target clothing image onto a reference person, which has two main disadvantages: cannot control the size and length precisely; unable to accurately estimate the user's figure in the case of users wearing thick clothes, resulting in inaccurate dressing effect. In this paper, we put forward an akin task that aims to dress clothing for underwear models. %, which is also an urgent need in e-commerce scenarios. To solve the above drawbacks, we propose a Shape Controllable Virtual Try-On Network (SC-VTON), where a graph attention network integrates the information of model and clothing to generate the warped clothing image. In addition, the control points are incorporated into SC-VTON for the desired clothing shape. Furthermore, by adding a Splitting Network and a Synthesis Network, we can use clothing/model pair data to help optimize the deformation module and generalize the task to the typical virtual try-on task. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve accurate shape control. Meanwhile, compared with other methods, our method can generate high-resolution results with detailed textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, conference</p></details> |

Despite tremendous progress of image virtual try-on, they lead to inconsistency between frames when applied to videos. Limited work also explored the task of video-based virtual try-on but failed to produce visually pleasing and temporally coherent results. Moreover, there are two other key challenges: 1) how to generate accurate warping when occlusions appear in the clothing region; 2) how to generate clothes and non-target body parts (e.g. arms, neck) in harmony with the complicated background; To address them, we propose a novel video virtual try-on framework, ClothFormer, which successfully synthesizes realistic, harmonious, and spatio-temporal consistent results in complicated environment. In particular, ClothFormer involves three major modules. First, a two-stage anti-occlusion warping module that predicts an accurate dense flow mapping between the body regions and the clothing regions. Second, an appearance-flow tracking module utilizes ridge regression and optical flow correction to smooth the dense flow sequence and generate a temporally smooth warped clothing sequence. Third, a dual-stream transformer extracts and fuses clothing textures, person features, and environment information to generate realistic try-on videos. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our method highly surpasses the baselines in terms of synthesized video quality both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2022 Oral, project page https://cloth-former.github.io</p></details> |

In addition, these methods usually mask the limb textures of the input for the clothing-agnostic person representation, which results in inaccurate predictions for human limb regions (i.e., the exposed arm skin), especially when transforming between long-sleeved and short-sleeved garments. To address these problems, we present a progressive virtual try-on framework, named PL-VTON, which performs pixel-level clothing warping based on multiple attributes of clothing and embeds explicit limb-aware features to generate photo-realistic try-on results. Specifically, we design a Multi-attribute Clothing Warping (MCW) module that adopts a two-stage alignment strategy based on multiple attributes to progressively estimate pixel-level clothing displacements. A Human Parsing Estimator (HPE) is then introduced to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and limb regions. Finally, we propose a Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) module to estimate high-quality details in limb regions by fusing textures of the clothing and the human body with the guidance of explicit limb-aware features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art virtual try-on methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Tremendous efforts have been made to facilitate this popular research area, but cannot keep the type of target clothing with the try-on area affected by original clothing. In this paper, we focus on the unpaired virtual try-on situation where target clothing and original clothing on the model are different, i.e., the practical scenario. To break the correlation between the try-on area and the original clothing and make the model learn the correct information to inpaint, we propose an adaptive mask training paradigm that dynamically adjusts training masks. It not only improves the alignment and fit of clothing but also significantly enhances the fidelity of virtual try-on experience. Furthermore, we for the first time propose two metrics for unpaired try-on evaluation, the Semantic-Densepose-Ratio (SDR) and Skeleton-LPIPS (S-LPIPS), to evaluate the correctness of clothing type and the accuracy of clothing texture. For unpaired try-on validation, we construct a comprehensive cross-try-on benchmark (Cross-27) with distinctive clothing items and model physiques, covering a broad try-on scenarios. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, contributing to the advancement of virtual try-on technology and offering new insights and tools for future research in the field. The code, model and benchmark will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D virtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment templates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual try-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans, but lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a novel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the merits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently and learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the first attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing and a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1) The Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth map and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage warping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the initial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3) The Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the non-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality synthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image is associated with a front and a back depth map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3D-VTON can manipulate and reconstruct the 3D human body wearing the given clothing with compelling details and is more efficient than other 3D approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2021</p></details> |

Directly applying the technique of image-based try-on to the video domain in a frame-wise manner will cause temporal-inconsistent outcomes while previous video-based try-on solutions can only generate low visual quality and blurring results. In this work, we present ViViD, a novel framework employing powerful diffusion models to tackle the task of video virtual try-on. Specifically, we design the Garment Encoder to extract fine-grained clothing semantic features, guiding the model to capture garment details and inject them into the target video through the proposed attention feature fusion mechanism. To ensure spatial-temporal consistency, we introduce a lightweight Pose Encoder to encode pose signals, enabling the model to learn the interactions between clothing and human posture and insert hierarchical Temporal Modules into the text-to-image stable diffusion model for more coherent and lifelike video synthesis. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset, which is the largest, with the most diverse types of garments and the highest resolution for the task of video virtual try-on to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to yield satisfactory video try-on results. The dataset, codes, and weights will be publicly available.

| **[Single Stage Multi-Pose Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10715v1)** | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-pose virtual try-on (MPVTON) aims to fit a target garment onto a person at a target pose. Compared to traditional virtual try-on (VTON) that fits the garment but keeps the pose unchanged, MPVTON provides a better try-on experience, but is also more challenging due to the dual garment and pose editing objectives. Existing MPVTON methods adopt a pipeline comprising three disjoint modules including a target semantic layout prediction module, a coarse try-on image generator and a refinement try-on image generator. These models are trained separately, leading to sub-optimal model training and unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a novel single stage model for MPVTON. Key to our model is a parallel flow estimation module that predicts the flow fields for both person and garment images conditioned on the target pose. The predicted flows are subsequently used to warp the appearance feature maps of the person and the garment images to construct a style map. The map is then used to modulate the target pose's feature map for target try-on image generation. With the parallel flow estimation design, our model can be trained end-to-end in a single stage and is more computationally efficient, resulting in new SOTA performance on existing MPVTON benchmarks. We further introduce multi-task training and demonstrate that our model can also be applied for traditional VTON and pose transfer tasks and achieve comparable performance to SOTA specialized models on both tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although virtual try-on has attracted considerable research initiatives, existing systems only focus on the quality of image generation, overlooking whether the fashion item is a good match to the given person and clothes. Recognizing this gap, we propose to design a one-stop Smart Fitting Room, with the novel formulation of matching-aware virtual try-on. Following this formulation, we design a Hybrid Matching-aware Virtual Try-On Framework (HMaVTON), which combines retrieval-based and generative methods to foster a more personalized virtual try-on experience. This framework integrates a hybrid mix-and-match module and an enhanced virtual try-on module. The former can recommend fashion items available on the platform to boost sales and generate clothes that meets the diverse tastes of consumers. The latter provides high-quality try-on effects, delivering a one-stop shopping service. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we enlist the expertise of fashion designers for a professional evaluation, assessing the rationality and diversity of the clothes combinations and conducting an evaluation matrix analysis. Our method significantly enhances the practicality of virtual try-on. The code is available at https://github.com/Yzcreator/HMaVTON.</p></details> |  |
| **[Virtual Accessory Try-On via Keypoint Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17131v1)** | 2023-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The virtual try-on task refers to fitting the clothes from one image onto another portrait image. In this paper, we focus on virtual accessory try-on, which fits accessory (e.g., glasses, ties) onto a face or portrait image. Unlike clothing try-on, which relies on human silhouette as guidance, accessory try-on warps the accessory into an appropriate location and shape to generate a plausible composite image. In contrast to previous try-on methods that treat foreground (i.e., accessories) and background (i.e., human faces or bodies) equally, we propose a background-oriented network to utilize the prior knowledge of human bodies and accessories. Specifically, our approach learns the human body priors and hallucinates the target locations of specified foreground keypoints in the background. Then our approach will inject foreground information with accessory priors into the background UNet. Based on the hallucinated target locations, the warping parameters are calculated to warp the foreground. Moreover, this background-oriented network can also easily incorporate auxiliary human face/body semantic segmentation supervision to further boost performance. Experiments conducted on STRAT dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

While the generative quality of diffusion models is impressive, achieving controllability poses a significant challenge when applying it to virtual try-on and multiple denoising iterations limit its potential for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose Controllable Accelerated virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model (CAT-DM). To enhance the controllability, a basic diffusion-based virtual try-on network is designed, which utilizes ControlNet to introduce additional control conditions and improves the feature extraction of garment images. In terms of acceleration, CAT-DM initiates a reverse denoising process with an implicit distribution generated by a pre-trained GAN-based model. Compared with previous try-on methods based on diffusion models, CAT-DM not only retains the pattern and texture details of the inshop garment but also reduces the sampling steps without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAT-DM against both GANbased and diffusion-based methods in producing more realistic images and accurately reproducing garment patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Model-Based Size Variable Virtual Try-On Technology and Evaluation Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00562v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, virtual try-on technology has become an essential tool to satisfy consumers' personalized clothing preferences. Diffusion-based virtual try-on systems aim to naturally align garments with target individuals, generating realistic and detailed try-on images. However, existing methods overlook the importance of garment size variations in meeting personalized consumer needs. To address this, we propose a novel virtual try-on method named SV-VTON, which introduces garment sizing concepts into virtual try-on tasks. The SV-VTON method first generates refined masks for multiple garment sizes, then integrates these masks with garment images at varying proportions, enabling virtual try-on simulations across different sizes. In addition, we developed a specialized size evaluation module to quantitatively assess the accuracy of size variations. This module calculates differences between generated size increments and international sizing standards, providing objective measurements of size accuracy. To further validate SV-VTON's generalization capability across different models, we conducted experiments on multiple SOTA Diffusion models. The results demonstrate that SV-VTON consistently achieves precise multi-size virtual try-on across various SOTA models, and validates the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method, significantly fulfilling users' personalized multi-size virtual try-on requirements.</p></details> |  |

| **[WAS-VTON: Warping Architecture Search for Virtual Try-on Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00386v1)** | 2021-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress on image-based virtual try-on, current methods are constraint by shared warping networks and thus fail to synthesize natural try-on results when faced with clothing categories that require different warping operations. In this paper, we address this problem by finding clothing category-specific warping networks for the virtual try-on task via Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We introduce a NAS-Warping Module and elaborately design a bilevel hierarchical search space to identify the optimal network-level and operation-level flow estimation architecture. Given the network-level search space, containing different numbers of warping blocks, and the operation-level search space with different convolution operations, we jointly learn a combination of repeatable warping cells and convolution operations specifically for the clothing-person alignment. Moreover, a NAS-Fusion Module is proposed to synthesize more natural final try-on results, which is realized by leveraging particular skip connections to produce better-fused features that are required for seamlessly fusing the warped clothing and the unchanged person part. We adopt an efficient and stable one-shot searching strategy to search the above two modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our WAS-VTON significantly outperforms the previous fixed-architecture try-on methods with more natural warping results and virtual try-on results.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Style Virtual Try on Network for Clothing Business Industry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13183v2)** | 2021-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing development of garment manufacturing industry, the method of combining neural network with industry to reduce product redundancy has been paid more and more attention.In order to reduce garment redundancy and achieve personalized customization, more researchers have appeared in the field of virtual trying on.They try to transfer the target clothing to the reference figure, and then stylize the clothes to meet user's requirements for fashion.But the biggest problem of virtual try on is that the shape and motion blocking distort the clothes, causing the patterns and texture on the clothes to be impossible to restore. This paper proposed a new stylized virtual try on network, which can not only retain the authenticity of clothing texture and pattern, but also obtain the undifferentiated stylized try on. The network is divided into three sub-networks, the first is the user image, the front of the target clothing image, the semantic segmentation image and the posture heat map to generate a more detailed human parsing map. Second, UV position map and dense correspondence are used to map patterns and textures to the deformed silhouettes in real time, so that they can be retained in real time, and the rationality of spatial structure can be guaranteed on the basis of improving the authenticity of images. Third,Stylize and adjust the generated virtual try on image. Through the most subtle changes, users can choose the texture, color and style of clothing to improve the user's experience.</p></details> | 10 pages,9 figures |

Using advanced diffusion models, DiffusionTrend harnesses latent information rich in prior information to capture the nuances of garment details. Throughout the diffusion denoising process, these details are seamlessly integrated into the model image generation, expertly directed by a precise garment mask crafted by a lightweight and compact CNN. Although our DiffusionTrend model initially demonstrates suboptimal metric performance, our exploratory approach offers some important advantages: (1) It circumvents resource-intensive retraining of diffusion models on large datasets. (2) It eliminates the necessity for various complex and user-unfriendly model inputs. (3) It delivers a visually compelling try-on experience, underscoring the potential of training-free diffusion model. This initial foray into the application of untrained diffusion models in virtual try-on technology potentially paves the way for further exploration and refinement in this industrially and academically valuable field.</p></details> |  |

In our research, we introduce an innovative approach for virtual clothes try-on, utilizing a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) coupled with a diffusion model. Our method emphasizes detail enhancement by contrasting local clothing image embeddings, generated by ViT, with their global counterparts. Techniques such as conditional guidance and focus on key regions have been integrated into our approach. These combined strategies empower the diffusion model to reproduce clothing details with increased clarity and realism. The experimental results showcase substantial advancements in the realism and precision of details in virtual try-on experiences, significantly surpassing the capabilities of existing technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.11026v1)** | 2019-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on system under arbitrary human poses has huge application potential, yet raises quite a lot of challenges, e.g. self-occlusions, heavy misalignment among diverse poses, and diverse clothes textures. Existing methods aim at fitting new clothes into a person can only transfer clothes on the fixed human pose, but still show unsatisfactory performances which often fail to preserve the identity, lose the texture details, and decrease the diversity of poses. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards multi-pose guided virtual try-on system, which enables transfer clothes on a person image under diverse poses. Given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and a desired pose, the proposed Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network (MG-VTON) can generate a new person image after fitting the desired clothes into the input image and manipulating human poses. Our MG-VTON is constructed in three stages: 1) a desired human parsing map of the target image is synthesized to match both the desired pose and the desired clothes shape; 2) a deep Warping Generative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) warps the desired clothes appearance into the synthesized human parsing map and alleviates the misalignment problem between the input human pose and desired human pose; 3) a refinement render utilizing multi-pose composition masks recovers the texture details of clothes and removes some artifacts. Extensive experiments on well-known datasets and our newly collected largest virtual try-on benchmark demonstrate that our MG-VTON significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively with promising multi-pose virtual try-on performances.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Significance of Anatomical Constraints in Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02110v1)** | 2024-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The system of Virtual Try-ON (VTON) allows a user to try a product virtually. In general, a VTON system takes a clothing source and a person's image to predict the try-on output of the person in the given clothing. Although existing methods perform well for simple poses, in case of bent or crossed arms posture or when there is a significant difference between the alignment of the source clothing and the pose of the target person, these methods fail by generating inaccurate clothing deformations. In the VTON methods that employ Thin Plate Spline (TPS) based clothing transformations, this mainly occurs for two reasons - (1)~the second-order smoothness constraint of TPS that restricts the bending of the object plane. (2)~Overlaps among different clothing parts (e.g., sleeves and torso) can not be modeled by a single TPS transformation, as it assumes the clothing as a single planar object; therefore, disregards the independence of movement of different clothing parts. To this end, we make two major contributions. Concerning the bending limitations of TPS, we propose a human AnaTomy-Aware Geometric (ATAG) transformation. Regarding the overlap issue, we propose a part-based warping approach that divides the clothing into independently warpable parts to warp them separately and later combine them. Extensive analysis shows the efficacy of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2208.08076</p></details> |

An example input includes: an image of a shirt, an image of a pair of pants, "rolled sleeves, shirt tucked in", and an image of a person. The output is a visualization of how those garments (in the desired layout) would look like on the given person. Key contributions of our method are: 1) a single stage diffusion based model, with no super resolution cascading, that allows to mix and match multiple garments at 1024x512 resolution preserving and warping intricate garment details, 2) architecture design (VTO UNet Diffusion Transformer) to disentangle denoising from person specific features, allowing for a highly effective finetuning strategy for identity preservation (6MB model per individual vs 4GB achieved with, e.g., dreambooth finetuning); solving a common identity loss problem in current virtual try-on methods, 3) layout control for multiple garments via text inputs specifically finetuned over PaLI-3 for virtual try-on task. Experimental results indicate that M&M VTO achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as opens up new opportunities for virtual try-on via language-guided and multi-garment try-on.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 Highlight.

The task requires trying on a clothing item on a target model image. An efficient framework for this is composed of two stages: (1) warping (transforming) the try-on cloth to align with the pose and shape of the target model, and (2) a texture transfer module to seamlessly integrate the warped try-on cloth onto the target model image. Existing methods suffer from artifacts and distortions in their try-on output. In this work, we present SieveNet, a framework for robust image-based virtual try-on. Firstly, we introduce a multi-stage coarse-to-fine warping network to better model fine-grained intricacies (while transforming the try-on cloth) and train it with a novel perceptual geometric matching loss. Next, we introduce a try-on cloth conditioned segmentation mask prior to improve the texture transfer network. Finally, we also introduce a dueling triplet loss strategy for training the texture translation network which further improves the quality of the generated try-on results. We present extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of each component of the proposed pipeline and show significant performance improvements against the current state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE WACV 2020</p></details> |
| **[Street TryOn: Learning In-the-Wild Virtual Try-On from Unpaired Person Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16094v3)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most virtual try-on research is motivated to serve the fashion business by generating images to demonstrate garments on studio models at a lower cost. However, virtual try-on should be a broader application that also allows customers to visualize garments on themselves using their own casual photos, known as in-the-wild try-on. Unfortunately, the existing methods, which achieve plausible results for studio try-on settings, perform poorly in the in-the-wild context. This is because these methods often require paired images (garment images paired with images of people wearing the same garment) for training. While such paired data is easy to collect from shopping websites for studio settings, it is difficult to obtain for in-the-wild scenes. In this work, we fill the gap by (1) introducing a StreetTryOn benchmark to support in-the-wild virtual try-on applications and (2) proposing a novel method to learn virtual try-on from a set of in-the-wild person images directly without requiring paired data. We tackle the unique challenges, including warping garments to more diverse human poses and rendering more complex backgrounds faithfully, by a novel DensePose warping correction method combined with diffusion-based conditional inpainting. Our experiments show competitive performance for standard studio try-on tasks and SOTA performance for street try-on and cross-domain try-on tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The abstract and intro are updated.

| **[Improving Diffusion Models for Authentic Virtual Try-on in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05139v3)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers image-based virtual try-on, which renders an image of a person wearing a curated garment, given a pair of images depicting the person and the garment, respectively. Previous works adapt existing exemplar-based inpainting diffusion models for virtual try-on to improve the naturalness of the generated visuals compared to other methods (e.g., GAN-based), but they fail to preserve the identity of the garments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model that improves garment fidelity and generates authentic virtual try-on images. Our method, coined IDM-VTON, uses two different modules to encode the semantics of garment image; given the base UNet of the diffusion model, 1) the high-level semantics extracted from a visual encoder are fused to the cross-attention layer, and then 2) the low-level features extracted from parallel UNet are fused to the self-attention layer. In addition, we provide detailed textual prompts for both garment and person images to enhance the authenticity of the generated visuals. Finally, we present a customization method using a pair of person-garment images, which significantly improves fidelity and authenticity. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches (both diffusion-based and GAN-based) in preserving garment details and generating authentic virtual try-on images, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the proposed customization method demonstrates its effectiveness in a real-world scenario.

Unlike existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer, which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-Guided Clothing Warping for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15232v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on aims to seamlessly fit in-shop clothing to a person image while maintaining pose consistency. Existing methods commonly employ the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform in-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising performance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details, leading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as well as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed SCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb textures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and try-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we devise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow path. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's body, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and post-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance flow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results, we integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network based on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are able to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and precise control over details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Due to the intricate tiny patterns and repeated geometric sub-structures in most ornaments, it is much more difficult to guarantee identity and appearance consistency under large pose and scale variances between ornaments and models. This paper proposes the task of virtual try-on for ornaments and presents a method to improve the geometric and appearance preservation of ornament virtual try-ons. Specifically, we estimate an accurate wearing mask to improve the alignments between ornaments and models in an iterative scheme alongside the denoising process. To preserve structure details, we further regularize attention layers to map the reference ornament mask to the wearing mask in an implicit way. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully wears ornaments from reference images onto target models, handling substantial differences in scale and pose while preserving identity and achieving realistic visual effects.</p></details> |  |

Given a garment, we preprocess a rich database of physically-based dressed character simulations, for multiple body shapes and animations. Then, using this database, we train a learning-based model of cloth drape and wrinkles, as a function of body shape and dynamics. We propose a model that separates global garment fit, due to body shape, from local garment wrinkles, due to both pose dynamics and body shape. We use a recurrent neural network to regress garment wrinkles, and we achieve highly plausible nonlinear effects, in contrast to the blending artifacts suffered by previous methods. At runtime, dynamic virtual try-on animations are produced in just a few milliseconds for garments with thousands of triangles.

| **[Video Virtual Try-on with Conditional Diffusion Transformer Inpainter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21270v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

A desirable pipeline should not only transform the target clothes into the most fitting shape seamlessly but also preserve well the clothes identity in the generated image, that is, the key characteristics (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) that depict the original clothes. However, previous image-conditioned generation works fail to meet these critical requirements towards the plausible virtual try-on performance since they fail to handle large spatial misalignment between the input image and target clothes. Prior work explicitly tackled spatial deformation using shape context matching, but failed to preserve clothing details due to its coarse-to-fine strategy. In this work, we propose a new fully-learnable Characteristic-Preserving Virtual Try-On Network(CP-VTON) for addressing all real-world challenges in this task. First, CP-VTON learns a thin-plate spline transformation for transforming the in-shop clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a new Geometric Matching Module (GMM) rather than computing correspondences of interest points as prior works did. Second, to alleviate boundary artifacts of warped clothes and make the results more realistic, we employ a Try-On Module that learns a composition mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered image to ensure smoothness. Extensive experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate our CP-VTON achieves the state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2018</p></details> |
| **[SPG-VTON: Semantic Prediction Guidance for Multi-pose Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01578v2)** | 2022-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on is challenging in fitting a target in-shop clothes into a reference person under diverse human poses. Previous works focus on preserving clothing details ( e.g., texture, logos, patterns ) when transferring desired clothes onto a target person under a fixed pose. However, the performances of existing methods significantly dropped when extending existing methods to multi-pose virtual try-on. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Semantic Prediction Guidance multi-pose Virtual Try-On Network (SPG-VTON), which could fit the desired clothing into a reference person under arbitrary poses. Concretely, SPG-VTON is composed of three sub-modules. First, a Semantic Prediction Module (SPM) generates the desired semantic map. The predicted semantic map provides more abundant guidance to locate the desired clothes region and produce a coarse try-on image. Second, a Clothes Warping Module (CWM) warps in-shop clothes to the desired shape according to the predicted semantic map and the desired pose. Specifically, we introduce a conductible cycle consistency loss to alleviate the misalignment in the clothes warping process. Third, a Try-on Synthesis Module (TSM) combines the coarse result and the warped clothes to generate the final virtual try-on image, preserving details of the desired clothes and under the desired pose. Besides, we introduce a face identity loss to refine the facial appearance and maintain the identity of the final virtual try-on result at the same time. We evaluate the proposed method on the most massive multi-pose dataset (MPV) and the DeepFashion dataset. The qualitative and quantitative experiments show that SPG-VTON is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to the data noise, including background and accessory changes, i.e., hats and handbags, showing good scalability to the real-world scenario.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, this paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3) integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on scenarios.

The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON recorded 92.5%, which is 15.4% better than Leffa in short-sleeved synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github : https://github.com/DevChoco/CAP-VTON</p></details> |
| **[ShineOn: Illuminating Design Choices for Practical Video-based Virtual Clothing Try-on](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10495v2)** | 2021-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on has garnered interest as a neural rendering benchmark task to evaluate complex object transfer and scene composition. Recent works in virtual clothing try-on feature a plethora of possible architectural and data representation choices. However, they present little clarity on quantifying the isolated visual effect of each choice, nor do they specify the hyperparameter details that are key to experimental reproduction. Our work, ShineOn, approaches the try-on task from a bottom-up approach and aims to shine light on the visual and quantitative effects of each experiment. We build a series of scientific experiments to isolate effective design choices in video synthesis for virtual clothing try-on. Specifically, we investigate the effect of different pose annotations, self-attention layer placement, and activation functions on the quantitative and qualitative performance of video virtual try-on. We find that DensePose annotations not only enhance face details but also decrease memory usage and training time. Next, we find that attention layers improve face and neck quality. Finally, we show that GELU and ReLU activation functions are the most effective in our experiments despite the appeal of newer activations such as Swish and Sine. We will release a well-organized code base, hyperparameters, and model checkpoints to support the reproducibility of our results. We expect our extensive experiments and code to greatly inform future design choices in video virtual try-on.

The main obstacle lies in preserving the details of the clothing and modeling the coherent motions simultaneously. Faced with those difficulties, we address video try-on by proposing a diffusion-based framework named "Tunnel Try-on." The core idea is excavating a "focus tunnel" in the input video that gives close-up shots around the clothing regions. We zoom in on the region in the tunnel to better preserve the fine details of the clothing. To generate coherent motions, we first leverage the Kalman filter to construct smooth crops in the focus tunnel and inject the position embedding of the tunnel into attention layers to improve the continuity of the generated videos. In addition, we develop an environment encoder to extract the context information outside the tunnels as supplementary cues. Equipped with these techniques, Tunnel Try-on keeps the fine details of the clothing and synthesizes stable and smooth videos. Demonstrating significant advancements, Tunnel Try-on could be regarded as the first attempt toward the commercial-level application of virtual try-on in videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mengtingchen.github.io/tunnel-try-on-page/</p></details> |

In this paper, we present IPVTON, a novel image-based 3D virtual try-on framework. IPVTON employs score distillation sampling with image prompts to optimize a hybrid 3D human representation, integrating target garment features into diffusion priors through an image prompt adapter. To avoid interference with non-target areas, we leverage mask-guided image prompt embeddings to focus the image features on the try-on regions. Moreover, we impose geometric constraints on the 3D model with a pseudo silhouette generated by ControlNet, ensuring that the clothed 3D human model retains the shape of the source identity while accurately wearing the target garments. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that IPVTON outperforms previous methods in image-based 3D virtual try-on tasks, excelling in both geometry and texture.</p></details> |  |

A comprehensive benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability, and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario, VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols, generated results, and human annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Websit: \url{https://github.com/HUuxiaobin/VTBench}</p></details> |

Recent methods model virtual try-on as image mask-inpaint task, which requires masking the person image and results in significant loss of spatial information. Especially, for in-the-wild try-on scenarios with complex poses and occlusions, mask-based methods often introduce noticeable artifacts. Our research found that a mask-free approach can fully leverage spatial and lighting information from the original person image, enabling high-quality virtual try-on. Consequently, we propose a novel training paradigm for a mask-free try-on diffusion model. We ensure the model's mask-free try-on capability by creating high-quality pseudo-data and further enhance its handling of complex spatial information through effective in-the-wild data augmentation. Besides, a try-on localization loss is designed to concentrate on try-on area while suppressing garment features in non-try-on areas, ensuring precise rendering of garments and preservation of fore/back-ground. In the end, we introduce BooW-VTON, the mask-free virtual try-on diffusion model, which delivers SOTA try-on quality without parsing cost. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated superior performance in wild scenarios with such a low-demand input.</p></details> |  |

Prior work focuses mainly on upper-body clothes (e.g. t-shirts, shirts, and tops) and neglects full-body or lower-body items. This shortcoming arises from a main factor: current publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on do not account for this variety, thus limiting progress in the field. To address this deficiency, we introduce Dress Code, which contains images of multi-category clothes. Dress Code is more than 3x larger than publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on and features high-resolution paired images (1024x768) with front-view, full-body reference models. To generate HD try-on images with high visual quality and rich in details, we propose to learn fine-grained discriminating features. Specifically, we leverage a semantic-aware discriminator that makes predictions at pixel-level instead of image- or patch-level. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach surpasses the baselines and state-of-the-art competitors in terms of visual quality and quantitative results.

To address this potential weakness, we propose a fill in fabrics (FIFA) model, a self-supervised conditional generative adversarial network based framework comprised of a Fabricator and a unified virtual try-on pipeline with a Segmenter, Warper and Fuser. The Fabricator aims to reconstruct the clothing image when provided with a masked clothing as input, and learns the overall structure of the clothing by filling in fabrics. A virtual try-on pipeline is then trained by transferring the learned representations from the Fabricator to Warper in an effort to warp and refine the target clothing. We also propose to use a multi-scale structural constraint to enforce global context at multiple scales while warping the target clothing to better fit the pose and shape of the person. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FIFA model achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard VITON dataset for virtual try-on of clothing items, and is shown to be effective at handling complex poses and retaining the texture and embroidery of the clothing.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step forwards to explore versatile virtual try-on solutions, which we argue should possess three main properties, namely, they should support unsupervised training, arbitrary garment categories, and controllable garment editing. To this end, we propose a characteristic-preserving end-to-end network, the PAtch-routed SpaTially-Adaptive GAN++ (PASTA-GAN++), to achieve a versatile system for high-resolution unpaired virtual try-on. Specifically, our PASTA-GAN++ consists of an innovative patch-routed disentanglement module to decouple the intact garment into normalized patches, which is capable of retaining garment style information while eliminating the garment spatial information, thus alleviating the overfitting issue during unsupervised training. Furthermore, PASTA-GAN++ introduces a patch-based garment representation and a patch-guided parsing synthesis block, allowing it to handle arbitrary garment categories and support local garment editing. Finally, to obtain try-on results with realistic texture details, PASTA-GAN++ incorporates a novel spatially-adaptive residual module to inject the coarse warped garment feature into the generator. Extensive experiments on our newly collected UnPaired virtual Try-on (UPT) dataset demonstrate the superiority of PASTA-GAN++ over existing SOTAs and its ability for controllable garment editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2111.10544</p></details> |

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To address this problem, virtual try-on systems have been developed to provide customers with a more realistic and personalized way to try on clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called ClothFit, which can predict the draping shape of a garment on a target body based on the actual size of the garment and human attributes. Unlike existing try-on models, ClothFit considers the actual body proportions of the person and available cloth sizes for clothing virtualization, making it more appropriate for current online apparel outlets. The proposed method utilizes a U-Net-based network architecture that incorporates cloth and human attributes to guide the realistic virtual try-on synthesis. Specifically, we extract features from a cloth image using an auto-encoder and combine them with features from the user's height, weight, and cloth size. The features are concatenated with the features from the U-Net encoder, and the U-Net decoder synthesizes the final virtual try-on image. Our experimental results demonstrate that ClothFit can significantly improve the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of photo-realistic virtual try-on results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2023 (ICIP 2023)</p></details> |

Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority'' completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an ''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment, effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps. Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detail preservation and image quality.

VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, in contrast, extracts standardized garment images from photos of clothed individuals. We introduce Multi-Garment TryOffDiff (MGT), a diffusion-based VTOFF model capable of handling diverse garment types, including upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. MGT builds on a latent diffusion architecture with SigLIP-based image conditioning to capture garment characteristics such as shape, texture, and pattern. To address garment diversity, MGT incorporates class-specific embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art VTOFF results on VITON-HD and competitive performance on DressCode. When paired with VTON models, it further enhances p2p-VTON by reducing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin tone, ensuring preservation of person-specific characteristics.

However, existing research has primarily overlooked a crucial aspect - the runtime of the underlying machine-learning model. While existing methods prioritize enhancing output quality, they often disregard the execution time, which restricts their applications on a limited range of devices. To address this gap, we propose Distilled Mobile Real-time Virtual Try-On (DM-VTON), a novel virtual try-on framework designed to achieve simplicity and efficiency. Our approach is based on a knowledge distillation scheme that leverages a strong Teacher network as supervision to guide a Student network without relying on human parsing. Notably, we introduce an efficient Mobile Generative Module within the Student network, significantly reducing the runtime while ensuring high-quality output. Additionally, we propose Virtual Try-on-guided Pose for Data Synthesis to address the limited pose variation observed in training images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 40 frames per second on a single Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU and only take up 37 MB of memory while producing almost the same output quality as other state-of-the-art methods. DM-VTON stands poised to facilitate the advancement of real-time AR applications, in addition to the generation of lifelike attired human figures tailored for diverse specialized training tasks. https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/DMVTON</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISMAR 2023 (Poster paper)</p></details> |

Prior virtual try-on works face two major challenges in achieving this goal: a) the paired (human, garment) training data has limited availability; b) generating textures on the human that perfectly match that of the prompted garment is difficult, often resulting in distorted text and faded textures. Our work explores ways to tackle these issues through both synthetic data as well as model refinement. We introduce a garment extraction model that generates (human, synthetic garment) pairs from a single image of a clothed individual. The synthetic pairs can then be used to augment the training of virtual try-on. We also propose an Error-Aware Refinement-based Schrödinger Bridge (EARSB) that surgically targets localized generation errors for correcting the output of a base virtual try-on model. To identify likely errors, we propose a weakly-supervised error classifier that localizes regions for refinement, subsequently augmenting the Schrödinger Bridge's noise schedule with its confidence heatmap. Experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode-Upper demonstrate that our synthetic data augmentation enhances the performance of prior work, while EARSB improves the overall image quality.

In this study, an image-based virtual try-on system that could adjust the clothing size was proposed. The size information of the person and clothing were used as the input for the proposed method to visualize the fitting of various clothing sizes in a virtual space. First, the distance between the shoulder width and height of the clothing in the person image is calculated based on the coordinate information of the key points detected by OpenPose. Then, the system changes the size of only the clothing area of the segmentation map, whose layout is estimated using the size of the person measured in the person image based on the ratio of the person and clothing sizes. If the size of the clothing area increases during the drawing, the details in the collar and overlapping areas are corrected to improve visual appearance.</p></details> |  |

Prior methods successfully preserve the character of clothing images, however, occlusion remains a pernicious effect for realistic virtual try-on. In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the occlusions and categorize them into two aspects: i) Inherent-Occlusion: the ghost of the former cloth still exists in the try-on image; ii) Acquired-Occlusion: the target cloth warps to the unreasonable body part. Based on the in-depth analysis, we find that the occlusions can be simulated by a novel semantically-guided mixup module, which can generate semantic-specific occluded images that work together with the try-on images to facilitate training a de-occlusion try-on (DOC-VTON) framework. Specifically, DOC-VTON first conducts a sharpened semantic parsing on the try-on person. Aided by semantics guidance and pose prior, various complexities of texture are selectively blending with human parts in a copy-and-paste manner. Then, the Generative Module (GM) is utilized to take charge of synthesizing the final try-on image and learning to de-occlusion jointly.

However, existing methods solely focus on the frontal try-on using the frontal clothing. When the views of the clothing and person are significantly inconsistent, particularly when the person's view is non-frontal, the results are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-View Virtual Try-ON (MV-VTON), which aims to reconstruct the dressing results from multiple views using the given clothes. Given that single-view clothes provide insufficient information for MV-VTON, we instead employ two images, i.e., the frontal and back views of the clothing, to encompass the complete view as much as possible. Moreover, we adopt diffusion models that have demonstrated superior abilities to perform our MV-VTON. In particular, we propose a view-adaptive selection method where hard-selection and soft-selection are applied to the global and local clothing feature extraction, respectively. This ensures that the clothing features are roughly fit to the person's view. Subsequently, we suggest joint attention blocks to align and fuse clothing features with person features. Additionally, we collect a MV-VTON dataset MVG, in which each person has multiple photos with diverse views and poses. Experiments show that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on MV-VTON task using our MVG dataset, but also has superiority on frontal-view virtual try-on task using VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by AAAI 2025.

The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://immortalco.github.io/VirtualFittingRoom/</p></details> |

It aims to synthesize images of a specific person wearing a specified garment. Diffusion model-based approaches have recently become popular, as they are excellent at image synthesis tasks. However, these approaches usually employ additional image encoders and rely on the cross-attention mechanism for texture transfer from the garment to the person image, which affects the try-on's efficiency and fidelity. To address these issues, we propose an Texture-Preserving Diffusion (TPD) model for virtual try-on, which enhances the fidelity of the results and introduces no additional image encoders. Accordingly, we make contributions from two aspects. First, we propose to concatenate the masked person and reference garment images along the spatial dimension and utilize the resulting image as the input for the diffusion model's denoising UNet. This enables the original self-attention layers contained in the diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate texture transfer. Second, we propose a novel diffusion-based method that predicts a precise inpainting mask based on the person and reference garment images, further enhancing the reliability of the try-on results. In addition, we integrate mask prediction and image synthesis into a single compact model. The experimental results show that our approach can be applied to various try-on tasks, e.g., garment-to-person and person-to-person try-ons, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular VITON, VITON-HD databases.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules and analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in the inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn garments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them along spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of CatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON consists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant image and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M parameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we identify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only 49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates unnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and captioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the virtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild scenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[High-Fidelity Virtual Try-on with Large-Scale Unpaired Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01593v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTON) transfers a target clothing image to a reference person, where clothing fidelity is a key requirement for downstream e-commerce applications. However, existing VTON methods still fall short in high-fidelity try-on due to the conflict between the high diversity of dressing styles (\eg clothes occluded by pants or distorted by posture) and the limited paired data for training. In this work, we propose a novel framework \textbf{Boosted Virtual Try-on (BVTON)} to leverage the large-scale unpaired learning for high-fidelity try-on. Our key insight is that pseudo try-on pairs can be reliably constructed from vastly available fashion images. Specifically, \textbf{1)} we first propose a compositional canonicalizing flow that maps on-model clothes into pseudo in-shop clothes, dubbed canonical proxy. Each clothing part (sleeves, torso) is reversely deformed into an in-shop-like shape to compositionally construct the canonical proxy. \textbf{2)} Next, we design a layered mask generation module that generates accurate semantic layout by training on canonical proxy. We replace the in-shop clothes used in conventional pipelines with the derived canonical proxy to boost the training process. \textbf{3)} Finally, we propose an unpaired try-on synthesizer by constructing pseudo training pairs with randomly misaligned on-model clothes, where intricate skin texture and clothes boundaries can be generated. Extensive experiments on high-resolution ($1024\times768$) datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Notably, BVTON shows great generalizability and scalability to various dressing styles and data sources.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Learning Implicit Features with Flow Infused Attention for Realistic Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11435v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on is challenging since the generated image should fit the garment to model images in various poses and keep the characteristics and details of the garment simultaneously. A popular research stream warps the garment image firstly to reduce the burden of the generation stage, which relies highly on the performance of the warping module. Other methods without explicit warping often lack sufficient guidance to fit the garment to the model images. In this paper, we propose FIA-VTON, which leverages the implicit warp feature by adopting a Flow Infused Attention module on virtual try-on. The dense warp flow map is projected as indirect guidance attention to enhance the feature map warping in the generation process implicitly, which is less sensitive to the warping estimation accuracy than an explicit warp of the garment image. To further enhance implicit warp guidance, we incorporate high-level spatial attention to complement the dense warp. Experimental results on the VTON-HD and DressCode dataset significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating that FIA-VTON is effective and robust for virtual try-on.</p></details> |  |
| **[VITON-HD: High-Resolution Virtual Try-On via Misalignment-Aware Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16874v2)** | 2021-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer a target clothing item onto the corresponding region of a person, which is commonly tackled by fitting the item to the desired body part and fusing the warped item with the person. While an increasing number of studies have been conducted, the resolution of synthesized images is still limited to low (e.g., 256x192), which acts as the critical limitation against satisfying online consumers. We argue that the limitation stems from several challenges: as the resolution increases, the artifacts in the misaligned areas between the warped clothes and the desired clothing regions become noticeable in the final results; the architectures used in existing methods have low performance in generating high-quality body parts and maintaining the texture sharpness of the clothes. To address the challenges, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called VITON-HD that successfully synthesizes 1024x768 virtual try-on images. Specifically, we first prepare the segmentation map to guide our virtual try-on synthesis, and then roughly fit the target clothing item to a given person's body. Next, we propose ALIgnment-Aware Segment (ALIAS) normalization and ALIAS generator to handle the misaligned areas and preserve the details of 1024x768 inputs. Through rigorous comparison with existing methods, we demonstrate that VITON-HD highly surpasses the baselines in terms of synthesized image quality both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, to achieve high-fidelity try-on performance, most state-of-the-art methods still rely on accurate segmentation masks, which are often produced by near-perfect parsers or manual labeling. To overcome the bottleneck, we propose a parser-free virtual try-on method based on the diffusion model (PFDM). Given two images, PFDM can "wear" garments on the target person seamlessly by implicitly warping without any other information. To learn the model effectively, we synthesize many pseudo-images and construct sample pairs by wearing various garments on persons. Supervised by the large-scale expanded dataset, we fuse the person and garment features using a proposed Garment Fusion Attention (GFA) mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed PFDM can successfully handle complex cases, synthesize high-fidelity images, and outperform both state-of-the-art parser-free and parser-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICASSP 2024</p></details> |

However, existing techniques are currently still limited in the quality of the try-on results they are able to produce from input images of diverse characteristics. In this work, we propose a Context-Driven Virtual Try-On Network (C-VTON) that addresses these limitations and convincingly transfers selected clothing items to the target subjects even under challenging pose configurations and in the presence of self-occlusions. At the core of the C-VTON pipeline are: (i) a geometric matching procedure that efficiently aligns the target clothing with the pose of the person in the input images, and (ii) a powerful image generator that utilizes various types of contextual information when synthesizing the final try-on result. C-VTON is evaluated in rigorous experiments on the VITON and MPV datasets and in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to produce photo-realistic and visually convincing results and significantly improves on the existing state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2022</p></details> |

Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO image conditioning. To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories, demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders.

Despite notable progress in single-image virtual try-on (VTO), current methodologies often struggle to preserve a consistent and authentic appearance of clothing across extended video sequences.

| **[EfficientVITON: An Efficient Virtual Try-On Model using Optimized Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11776v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Would not it be much more convenient for everybody to try on clothes by only looking into a mirror ? The answer to that problem is virtual try-on, enabling users to digitally experiment with outfits. The core challenge lies in realistic image-to-image translation, where clothing must fit diverse human forms, poses, and figures. Early methods, which used 2D transformations, offered speed, but image quality was often disappointing and lacked the nuance of deep learning. Though GAN-based techniques enhanced realism, their dependence on paired data proved limiting. More adaptable methods offered great visuals but demanded significant computing power and time. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for high-fidelity translation, yet the current crop of virtual try-on tools still struggle with detail loss and warping issues. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes EfficientVITON, a new virtual try-on system leveraging the impressive pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for better images and deployment feasibility. The system includes a spatial encoder to maintain clothings finer details and zero cross-attention blocks to capture the subtleties of how clothes fit a human body. Input images are carefully prepared, and the diffusion process has been tweaked to significantly cut generation time without image quality loss. The training process involves two distinct stages of fine-tuning, carefully incorporating a balance of loss functions to ensure both accurate try-on results and high-quality visuals. Rigorous testing on the VITON-HD dataset, supplemented with real-world examples, has demonstrated that EfficientVITON achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Our method first reasons the transfer parsing to provide shape prior to downstream tasks. We employ a multi-phase teaching strategy to supervise the training of the transfer parsing reasoning model, learning the response and feature knowledge from the try-on parsing reasoning model. To correct the teaching error, it transfers the garment back to its owner to absorb the hard knowledge in the self-study phase. Guided by the transfer parsing, we adjust the position of the transferred garment via STN to prevent distortion. Afterward, we estimate a progressive flow to precisely warp the garment with shape and content correspondences. To ensure warping rationality, we supervise the training of the garment warping model using target shape and warping knowledge from virtual try-on. To better preserve body features in the transfer result, we propose a well-designed training strategy for the arm regrowth task to infer new exposure skin. Experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance compared with other virtual try-on and garment transfer methods in garment transfer, especially for preserving garment texture and body features.</p></details> |  |

We leverage the power of pretrained latent diffusion models, designing an outfitting UNet to learn the garment detail features. Without a redundant warping process, the garment features are precisely aligned with the target human body via the proposed outfitting fusion in the self-attention layers of the denoising UNet. In order to further enhance the controllability, we introduce outfitting dropout to the training process, which enables us to adjust the strength of the garment features through classifier-free guidance. Our comprehensive experiments on the VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets demonstrate that OOTDiffusion efficiently generates high-quality try-on results for arbitrary human and garment images, which outperforms other VTON methods in both realism and controllability, indicating an impressive breakthrough in virtual try-on.

| **[A Two-stage Personalized Virtual Try-on Framework with Shape Control and Texture Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15480v1)** | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Diffusion model has a strong ability to generate wild images. However, the model can just generate inaccurate images with the guidance of text, which makes it very challenging to directly apply the text-guided generative model for virtual try-on scenarios. Taking images as guiding conditions of the diffusion model, this paper proposes a brand new personalized virtual try-on model (PE-VITON), which uses the two stages (shape control and texture guidance) to decouple the clothing attributes. Specifically, the proposed model adaptively matches the clothing to human body parts through the Shape Control Module (SCM) to mitigate the misalignment of the clothing and the human body parts. The semantic information of the input clothing is parsed by the Texture Guided Module (TGM), and the corresponding texture is generated by directional guidance. Therefore, this model can effectively solve the problems of weak reduction of clothing folds, poor generation effect under complex human posture, blurred edges of clothing, and unclear texture styles in traditional try-on methods. Meanwhile, the model can automatically enhance the generated clothing folds and textures according to the human posture, and improve the authenticity of virtual try-on. In this paper, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out on high-resolution paired and unpaired datasets, the results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model.</p></details> |  |

Conditioned upon a new clothing-agnostic yet descriptive person representation, our framework first generates a coarse synthesized image with the target clothing item overlaid on that same person in the same pose. We further enhance the initial blurry clothing area with a refinement network. The network is trained to learn how much detail to utilize from the target clothing item, and where to apply to the person in order to synthesize a photo-realistic image in which the target item deforms naturally with clear visual patterns. Experiments on our newly collected Zalando dataset demonstrate its promise in the image-based virtual try-on task over state-of-the-art generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Significance of Skeleton-based Features in Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08076v3)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of \textit{Virtual Try-ON} (VTON) benefits e-retailing by giving an user the convenience of trying a clothing at the comfort of their home. In general, most of the existing VTON methods produce inconsistent results when a person posing with his arms folded i.e., bent or crossed, wants to try an outfit. The problem becomes severe in the case of long-sleeved outfits. As then, for crossed arm postures, overlap among different clothing parts might happen. The existing approaches, especially the warping-based methods employing \textit{Thin Plate Spline (TPS)} transform can not tackle such cases. To this end, we attempt a solution approach where the clothing from the source person is segmented into semantically meaningful parts and each part is warped independently to the shape of the person. To address the bending issue, we employ hand-crafted geometric features consistent with human body geometry for warping the source outfit. In addition, we propose two learning-based modules: a synthesizer network and a mask prediction network. All these together attempt to produce a photo-realistic, pose-robust VTON solution without requiring any paired training data. Comparison with some of the benchmark methods clearly establishes the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Unlike prior arts constrained by specific input types, our method allows flexible specification of style (text or image) and texture (full garment, cropped sections, or texture patches) conditions. To address the entanglement challenge when using full garment images as conditions, we develop a two-stage pipeline with explicit disentanglement of style and texture. In the first stage, we generate a human parsing map reflecting the desired style conditioned on the input. In the second stage, we composite textures onto the parsing map areas based on the texture input. To represent complex and non-stationary textures that have never been achieved in previous fashion editing works, we first propose extracting hierarchical and balanced CLIP features and applying position encoding in VTON. Experiments demonstrate superior synthesis quality and personalization enabled by our method. The flexible control over style and texture mixing brings virtual try-on to a new level of user experience for online shopping and fashion design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ningshuliang.github.io/2023/Arxiv/index.html</p></details> |

This task requires to fit an in-shop cloth image on the image of a person. It is highly challenging because it requires to warp the cloth on the target person while preserving its patterns and characteristics, and to compose the item with the person in a realistic manner. Current state-of-the-art models generate images with visible artifacts, due either to a pixel-level composition step or to the geometric transformation. In this paper, we propose WUTON: a Warping U-net for a Virtual Try-On system. It is a siamese U-net generator whose skip connections are geometrically transformed by a convolutional geometric matcher. The whole architecture is trained end-to-end with a multi-task loss including an adversarial one. This enables our network to generate and use realistic spatial transformations of the cloth to synthesize images of high visual quality. The proposed architecture can be trained end-to-end and allows us to advance towards a detail-preserving and photo-realistic 2D virtual try-on system. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art with visual results as well as with the Learned Perceptual Image Similarity (LPIPS) metric.</p></details> |  |

A computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |
| **[High-Resolution Virtual Try-On with Misalignment and Occlusion-Handled Conditions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14180v2)** | 2022-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on aims to synthesize an image of a person wearing a given clothing item. To solve the task, the existing methods warp the clothing item to fit the person's body and generate the segmentation map of the person wearing the item before fusing the item with the person. However, when the warping and the segmentation generation stages operate individually without information exchange, the misalignment between the warped clothes and the segmentation map occurs, which leads to the artifacts in the final image. The information disconnection also causes excessive warping near the clothing regions occluded by the body parts, so-called pixel-squeezing artifacts. To settle the issues, we propose a novel try-on condition generator as a unified module of the two stages (i.e., warping and segmentation generation stages). A newly proposed feature fusion block in the condition generator implements the information exchange, and the condition generator does not create any misalignment or pixel-squeezing artifacts. We also introduce discriminator rejection that filters out the incorrect segmentation map predictions and assures the performance of virtual try-on frameworks. Experiments on a high-resolution dataset demonstrate that our model successfully handles the misalignment and occlusion, and significantly outperforms the baselines.

| **[SwiftTry: Fast and Consistent Video Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10178v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an input video of a person and a new garment, the objective of this paper is to synthesize a new video where the person is wearing the specified garment while maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. Although significant advances have been made in image-based virtual try-on, extending these successes to video often leads to frame-to-frame inconsistencies. Some approaches have attempted to address this by increasing the overlap of frames across multiple video chunks, but this comes at a steep computational cost due to the repeated processing of the same frames, especially for long video sequences. To tackle these challenges, we reconceptualize video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, with garments serving as input conditions. Specifically, our approach enhances image diffusion models by incorporating temporal attention layers to improve temporal coherence. To reduce computational overhead, we propose ShiftCaching, a novel technique that maintains temporal consistency while minimizing redundant computations. Furthermore, we introduce the TikTokDress dataset, a new video try-on dataset featuring more complex backgrounds, challenging movements, and higher resolution compared to existing public datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current baselines, particularly in terms of video consistency and inference speed.

| **[Pursuing Temporal-Consistent Video Virtual Try-On via Dynamic Pose Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16980v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Arbitrary Virtual Try-On Network: Characteristics Preservation and Trade-off between Body and Clothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12346v1)** | 2021-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based virtual try-on system has achieved some encouraging progress recently, but there still remain several big challenges that need to be solved, such as trying on arbitrary clothes of all types, trying on the clothes from one category to another and generating image-realistic results with few artifacts. To handle this issue, we in this paper first collect a new dataset with all types of clothes, \ie tops, bottoms, and whole clothes, each one has multiple categories with rich information of clothing characteristics such as patterns, logos, and other details. Based on this dataset, we then propose the Arbitrary Virtual Try-On Network (AVTON) that is utilized for all-type clothes, which can synthesize realistic try-on images by preserving and trading off characteristics of the target clothes and the reference person. Our approach includes three modules: 1) Limbs Prediction Module, which is utilized for predicting the human body parts by preserving the characteristics of the reference person. This is especially good for handling cross-category try-on task (\eg long sleeves \(\leftrightarrow\) short sleeves or long pants \(\leftrightarrow\) skirts, \etc), where the exposed arms or legs with the skin colors and details can be reasonably predicted; 2) Improved Geometric Matching Module, which is designed to warp clothes according to the geometry of the target person. We improve the TPS based warping method with a compactly supported radial function (Wendland's \(Ψ\)-function); 3) Trade-Off Fusion Module, which is to trade off the characteristics of the warped clothes and the reference person. This module is to make the generated try-on images look more natural and realistic based on a fine-tune symmetry of the network structure. Extensive simulations are conducted and our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art virtual try-on methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossVTON: Mimicking the Logic Reasoning on Cross-category Virtual Try-on guided by Tri-zone Priors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14373v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable progress in image-based virtual try-on systems, generating realistic and robust fitting images for cross-category virtual try-on remains a challenging task. The primary difficulty arises from the absence of human-like reasoning, which involves addressing size mismatches between garments and models while recognizing and leveraging the distinct functionalities of various regions within the model images. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from human cognitive processes and disentangle the complex reasoning required for cross-category try-on into a structured framework. This framework systematically decomposes the model image into three distinct regions: try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones. Each zone plays a specific role in accommodating the garment and facilitating realistic synthesis. To endow the model with robust reasoning capabilities for cross-category scenarios, we propose an iterative data constructor. This constructor encompasses diverse scenarios, including intra-category try-on, any-to-dress transformations (replacing any garment category with a dress), and dress-to-any transformations (replacing a dress with another garment category). Utilizing the generated dataset, we introduce a tri-zone priors generator that intelligently predicts the try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones by analyzing how the input garment is expected to align with the model image. Guided by these tri-zone priors, our proposed method, CrossVTON, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, it demonstrates superior capability in handling cross-category virtual try-on, meeting the complex demands of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Barrier Dataset Collection with Real Human Body for Interactive Per-Garment Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10468v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1) the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based methods, in particular, can create high-quality images, but they struggle to maintain the identities of the input garments. We identified this problem stems from the specifics in the training formulation for diffusion. To address this, we propose a unique training scheme that limits the scope in which diffusion is trained. We use a control image that perfectly aligns with the target image during training. In turn, this accurately preserves garment details during inference. We demonstrate our method not only effectively conserves garment details but also allows for layering, styling, and shoe try-on. Our method runs multi-garment try-on in a single inference cycle and can support high-quality zoomed-in generations without training in higher resolutions. Finally, we show our method surpasses prior methods in accuracy and quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Style-Based Global Appearance Flow for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01046v1)** | 2022-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on aims to fit an in-shop garment into a clothed person image. To achieve this, a key step is garment warping which spatially aligns the target garment with the corresponding body parts in the person image. Prior methods typically adopt a local appearance flow estimation model. They are thus intrinsically susceptible to difficult body poses/occlusions and large mis-alignments between person and garment images (see Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}). To overcome this limitation, a novel global appearance flow estimation model is proposed in this work. For the first time, a StyleGAN based architecture is adopted for appearance flow estimation. This enables us to take advantage of a global style vector to encode a whole-image context to cope with the aforementioned challenges. To guide the StyleGAN flow generator to pay more attention to local garment deformation, a flow refinement module is introduced to add local context. Experiment results on a popular virtual try-on benchmark show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. It is particularly effective in a `in-the-wild' application scenario where the reference image is full-body resulting in a large mis-alignment with the garment image (Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1} Top).

Different from previous methods, Wear-Any-Way is a customizable solution. Besides generating high-fidelity results, our method supports users to precisely manipulate the wearing style. To achieve this goal, we first construct a strong pipeline for standard virtual try-on, supporting single/multiple garment try-on and model-to-model settings in complicated scenarios. To make it manipulable, we propose sparse correspondence alignment which involves point-based control to guide the generation for specific locations. With this design, Wear-Any-Way gets state-of-the-art performance for the standard setting and provides a novel interaction form for customizing the wearing style. For instance, it supports users to drag the sleeve to make it rolled up, drag the coat to make it open, and utilize clicks to control the style of tuck, etc. Wear-Any-Way enables more liberated and flexible expressions of the attires, holding profound implications in the fashion industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mengtingchen.github.io/wear-any-way-page/</p></details> |
| **[PG-VTON: A Novel Image-Based Virtual Try-On Method via Progressive Inference Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08956v2)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on is a promising computer vision topic with a high commercial value wherein a new garment is visually worn on a person with a photo-realistic effect. Previous studies conduct their shape and content inference at one stage, employing a single-scale warping mechanism and a relatively unsophisticated content inference mechanism. These approaches have led to suboptimal results in terms of garment warping and skin reservation under challenging try-on scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel virtual try-on method via progressive inference paradigm (PGVTON) that leverages a top-down inference pipeline and a general garment try-on strategy. Specifically, we propose a robust try-on parsing inference method by disentangling semantic categories and introducing consistency. Exploiting the try-on parsing as the shape guidance, we implement the garment try-on via warping-mapping-composition. To facilitate adaptation to a wide range of try-on scenarios, we adopt a covering more and selecting one warping strategy and explicitly distinguish tasks based on alignment. Additionally, we regulate StyleGAN2 to implement re-naked skin inpainting, conditioned on the target skin shape and spatial-agnostic skin features. Experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance under two challenging scenarios. The code will be available at https://github.com/NerdFNY/PGVTON.</p></details> |  |
| **[Per Garment Capture and Synthesis for Real-time Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04654v1)** | 2021-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on is a promising application of computer graphics and human computer interaction that can have a profound real-world impact especially during this pandemic. Existing image-based works try to synthesize a try-on image from a single image of a target garment, but it inherently limits the ability to react to possible interactions. It is difficult to reproduce the change of wrinkles caused by pose and body size change, as well as pulling and stretching of the garment by hand. In this paper, we propose an alternative per garment capture and synthesis workflow to handle such rich interactions by training the model with many systematically captured images. Our workflow is composed of two parts: garment capturing and clothed person image synthesis. We designed an actuated mannequin and an efficient capturing process that collects the detailed deformations of the target garments under diverse body sizes and poses. Furthermore, we proposed to use a custom-designed measurement garment, and we captured paired images of the measurement garment and the target garments. We then learn a mapping between the measurement garment and the target garments using deep image-to-image translation. The customer can then try on the target garments interactively during online shopping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to UIST2021.

| **[DS-VTON: An Enhanced Dual-Scale Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00908v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures and patterns. These two requirements map directly onto a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, where the coarse stage handles structural alignment and the fine stage recovers rich garment details. Motivated by this observation, we propose DS-VTON, an enhanced dual-scale coarse-to-fine framework that tackles the try-on problem more effectively. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment. In the second stage, a blend-refine diffusion process reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between scales through noise-image blending, emphasizing texture fidelity and effectively correcting fine-detail errors from the low-resolution stage. In addition, our method adopts a fully mask-free generation strategy, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or segmentation masks. Extensive experiments show that DS-VTON not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but consistently and significantly surpasses prior methods in both structural alignment and texture fidelity across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Limb-Aware Virtual Try-On Network with Progressive Clothing Warping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14074v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer an in-shop clothing image to a person image. Most existing methods adopt a single global deformation to perform clothing warping directly, which lacks fine-grained modeling of in-shop clothing and leads to distorted clothing appearance. In addition, existing methods usually fail to generate limb details well because they are limited by the used clothing-agnostic person representation without referring to the limb textures of the person image. To address these problems, we propose Limb-aware Virtual Try-on Network named PL-VTON, which performs fine-grained clothing warping progressively and generates high-quality try-on results with realistic limb details. Specifically, we present Progressive Clothing Warping (PCW) that explicitly models the location and size of in-shop clothing and utilizes a two-stage alignment strategy to progressively align the in-shop clothing with the human body. Moreover, a novel gravity-aware loss that considers the fit of the person wearing clothing is adopted to better handle the clothing edges. Then, we design Person Parsing Estimator (PPE) with a non-limb target parsing map to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and body regions. Finally, we introduce Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) that focuses on generating realistic details in limb regions, where a coarse try-on result is first generated by fusing the warped clothing image with the person image, then limb textures are further fused with the coarse result under limb-aware guidance to refine limb details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PL-VTON outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM).

| **[Taming the Power of Diffusion Models for High-Quality Virtual Try-On with Appearance Flow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06101v1)** | 2023-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on is a critical image synthesis task that aims to transfer clothes from one image to another while preserving the details of both humans and clothes. While many existing methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve this, flaws can still occur, particularly at high resolutions. Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a promising alternative for generating high-quality images in various applications. However, simply using clothes as a condition for guiding the diffusion model to inpaint is insufficient to maintain the details of the clothes. To overcome this challenge, we propose an exemplar-based inpainting approach that leverages a warping module to guide the diffusion model's generation effectively. The warping module performs initial processing on the clothes, which helps to preserve the local details of the clothes. We then combine the warped clothes with clothes-agnostic person image and add noise as the input of diffusion model. Additionally, the warped clothes is used as local conditions for each denoising process to ensure that the resulting output retains as much detail as possible. Our approach, namely Diffusion-based Conditional Inpainting for Virtual Try-ON (DCI-VTON), effectively utilizes the power of the diffusion model, and the incorporation of the warping module helps to produce high-quality and realistic virtual try-on results. Experimental results on VITON-HD demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2023</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead. This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode, and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To alleviate these issues caused by the diffusion stochastic nature and latent supervision, we propose a novel Faithful Latent Diffusion Model for VTON, termed FLDM-VTON. FLDM-VTON improves the conventional latent diffusion process in three major aspects. First, we propose incorporating warped clothes as both the starting point and local condition, supplying the model with faithful clothes priors. Second, we introduce a novel clothes flattening network to constrain generated try-on images, providing clothes-consistent faithful supervision. Third, we devise a clothes-posterior sampling for faithful inference, further enhancing the model performance over conventional clothes-agnostic Gaussian sampling. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets demonstrate that our FLDM-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is able to generate photo-realistic try-on images with faithful clothing details.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods commonly resort to duplicated backbones or additional image encoders to extract garment features, which increases computational overhead and network complexity. In this paper, we propose ITVTON, an efficient framework that leverages the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as its single generator to improve image fidelity. By concatenating garment and person images along the width dimension and incorporating textual descriptions from both, ITVTON effectively captures garment-person interactions while preserving realism. To further reduce computational cost, we restrict training to the attention parameters within a single Diffusion Transformer (Single-DiT) block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITVTON surpasses baseline methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, setting a new standard for virtual try-on.

In addition to the fidelity of the synthesized images, the efficiency of the synthesis process presents a significant hurdle. Various existing approaches are explored, highlighting the limitations and unresolved aspects, e.g., identity information omission, uncontrollable artifacts, and low synthesis speed. It then proposes a novel diffusion-based solution that addresses garment texture preservation and user identity retention during virtual try-on. The proposed network comprises two primary modules - a warping module aligning clothing with individual features and a try-on module refining the attire and generating missing parts integrated with a mask-aware post-processing technique ensuring the integrity of the individual's identity. It demonstrates impressive results, surpassing the state-of-the-art in speed by nearly 20 times during inference, with superior fidelity in qualitative assessments. Quantitative evaluations confirm comparable performance with the recent SOTA method on the VITON-HD and Dresscode datasets.

However, the use of text prompts in virtual try-on remains underexplored. This paper tackles a text-editable virtual try-on task that modifies the clothing based on the provided clothing image while editing the wearing style (e.g., tucking style, fit) according to the text descriptions. In the text-editable virtual try-on, three key aspects exist: (i) designing rich text descriptions for paired person-clothing data to train the model, (ii) addressing the conflicts where textual information of the existing person's clothing interferes the generation of the new clothing, and (iii) adaptively adjust the inpainting mask aligned with the text descriptions, ensuring proper editing areas while preserving the original person's appearance irrelevant to the new clothing. To address these aspects, we propose PromptDresser, a text-editable virtual try-on model that leverages large multimodal model (LMM) assistance to enable high-quality and versatile manipulation based on generative text prompts. Our approach utilizes LMMs via in-context learning to generate detailed text descriptions for person and clothing images independently, including pose details and editing attributes using minimal human cost. Moreover, to ensure the editing areas, we adjust the inpainting mask depending on the text prompts adaptively. Our approach enhances text editability while effectively conveying clothing details that are difficult to capture through images alone, leading to improved image quality. Experiments show that PromptDresser significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating superior text-driven control and versatile clothing manipulation.

A key challenge of try-on is to generate realistic images of the model wearing the garments while preserving the details of the garments. Previous methods focus on masking certain parts of the original model's standing image, and then inpainting on masked areas to generate realistic images of the model wearing corresponding reference garments, which treat the try-on task as an inpainting task. However, such implements require the user to provide a complete, high-quality standing image, which is user-unfriendly in practical applications. In this paper, we propose Try-On-Adapter (TOA), an outpainting paradigm that differs from the existing inpainting paradigm. Our TOA can preserve the given face and garment, naturally imagine the rest parts of the image, and provide flexible control ability with various conditions, e.g., garment properties and human pose. In the experiments, TOA shows excellent performance on the virtual try-on task even given relatively low-quality face and garment images in qualitative comparisons. Additionally, TOA achieves the state-of-the-art performance of FID scores 5.56 and 7.23 for paired and unpaired on the VITON-HD dataset in quantitative comparisons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Image...</summary><p>Image virtual try-on, 7 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Previous research on video try-on has primarily focused on transferring product clothing images to videos with simple human poses, while performing poorly with complex movements. To better preserve clothing details, those approaches are armed with an additional garment encoder, resulting in higher computational resource consumption. The primary challenges in this domain are twofold: (1) leveraging the garment encoder's capabilities in video try-on while lowering computational requirements; (2) ensuring temporal consistency in the synthesis of human body parts, especially during rapid movements. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel video try-on framework based on Diffusion Transformer(DiT), named Dynamic Try-On. To reduce computational overhead, we adopt a straightforward approach by utilizing the DiT backbone itself as the garment encoder and employing a dynamic feature fusion module to store and integrate garment features. To ensure temporal consistency of human body parts, we introduce a limb-aware dynamic attention module that enforces the DiT backbone to focus on the regions of human limbs during the denoising process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Dynamic Try-On in generating stable and smooth try-on results, even for videos featuring complicated human postures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhengjun-ai.github.io/dynamic-tryon-page/.

| **[One Model For All: Partial Diffusion for Unified Try-On and Try-Off in Any Pose](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04559v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment, the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis.

By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks.

The main obstacle lies in preserving the details of the clothing and modeling the coherent motions simultaneously. Faced with those difficulties, we address video try-on by proposing a diffusion-based framework named "Tunnel Try-on." The core idea is excavating a "focus tunnel" in the input video that gives close-up shots around the clothing regions. We zoom in on the region in the tunnel to better preserve the fine details of the clothing. To generate coherent motions, we first leverage the Kalman filter to construct smooth crops in the focus tunnel and inject the position embedding of the tunnel into attention layers to improve the continuity of the generated videos. In addition, we develop an environment encoder to extract the context information outside the tunnels as supplementary cues. Equipped with these techniques, Tunnel Try-on keeps the fine details of the clothing and synthesizes stable and smooth videos. Demonstrating significant advancements, Tunnel Try-on could be regarded as the first attempt toward the commercial-level application of virtual try-on in videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://mengtingchen.github.io/tunnel-try-on-page/</p></details> |

While previous image-based virtual try-on methods can produce highly natural try-on images, these methods fit the clothes on the person without considering the relative relationship between the physical sizes of the clothes and the person. Different from these methods, our method achieves size-variable virtual try-on in which the image size of the try-on clothes is changed depending on this relative relationship of the physical sizes. To relieve the difficulty in maintaining the physical size of the closes while synthesizing the high-fidelity image of the whole clothes, our proposed method focuses on the residual between the silhouettes of the clothes in the reference and try-on images. We also develop a size-variable virtual try-on dataset consisting of 1,524 images provided by 26 subjects. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation metric for size-variable virtual-try-on. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our method can achieve size-variable virtual try-on better than general virtual try-on methods.</p></details> |  |

Compared to traditional virtual try-on (VTON) that fits the garment but keeps the pose unchanged, MPVTON provides a better try-on experience, but is also more challenging due to the dual garment and pose editing objectives. Existing MPVTON methods adopt a pipeline comprising three disjoint modules including a target semantic layout prediction module, a coarse try-on image generator and a refinement try-on image generator. These models are trained separately, leading to sub-optimal model training and unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a novel single stage model for MPVTON. Key to our model is a parallel flow estimation module that predicts the flow fields for both person and garment images conditioned on the target pose. The predicted flows are subsequently used to warp the appearance feature maps of the person and the garment images to construct a style map. The map is then used to modulate the target pose's feature map for target try-on image generation. With the parallel flow estimation design, our model can be trained end-to-end in a single stage and is more computationally efficient, resulting in new SOTA performance on existing MPVTON benchmarks. We further introduce multi-task training and demonstrate that our model can also be applied for traditional VTON and pose transfer tasks and achieve comparable performance to SOTA specialized models on both tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Cross-Attention Network for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15542v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an innovative solution for the challenges of the virtual try-on task: our novel Hierarchical Cross-Attention Network (HCANet). HCANet is crafted with two primary stages: geometric matching and try-on, each playing a crucial role in delivering realistic virtual try-on outcomes. A key feature of HCANet is the incorporation of a novel Hierarchical Cross-Attention (HCA) block into both stages, enabling the effective capture of long-range correlations between individual and clothing modalities. The HCA block enhances the depth and robustness of the network. By adopting a hierarchical approach, it facilitates a nuanced representation of the interaction between the person and clothing, capturing intricate details essential for an authentic virtual try-on experience. Our experiments establish the prowess of HCANet. The results showcase its performance across both quantitative metrics and subjective evaluations of visual realism. HCANet stands out as a state-of-the-art solution, demonstrating its capability to generate virtual try-on results that excel in accuracy and realism. This marks a significant step in advancing virtual try-on technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[VTON-IT: Virtual Try-On using Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04558v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Try-On (trying clothes virtually) is a promising application of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, it is an arduous task to transfer the desired clothing item onto the corresponding regions of a human body because of varying body size, pose, and occlusions like hair and overlapped clothes. In this paper, we try to produce photo-realistic translated images through semantic segmentation and a generative adversarial architecture-based image translation network. We present a novel image-based Virtual Try-On application VTON-IT that takes an RGB image, segments desired body part, and overlays target cloth over the segmented body region. Most state-of-the-art GAN-based Virtual Try-On applications produce unaligned pixelated synthesis images on real-life test images. However, our approach generates high-resolution natural images with detailed textures on such variant images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangled Cycle Consistency for Highly-realistic Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09479v2)** | 2021-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image virtual try-on replaces the clothes on a person image with a desired in-shop clothes image. It is challenging because the person and the in-shop clothes are unpaired. Existing methods formulate virtual try-on as either in-painting or cycle consistency. Both of these two formulations encourage the generation networks to reconstruct the input image in a self-supervised manner. However, existing methods do not differentiate clothing and non-clothing regions. A straight-forward generation impedes virtual try-on quality because of the heavily coupled image contents. In this paper, we propose a Disentangled Cycle-consistency Try-On Network (DCTON). The DCTON is able to produce highly-realistic try-on images by disentangling important components of virtual try-on including clothes warping, skin synthesis, and image composition. To this end, DCTON can be naturally trained in a self-supervised manner following cycle consistency learning. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that DCTON outperforms state-of-the-art approaches favorably.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2021 |
| **[Cloth Interactive Transformer for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05519v2)** | 2023-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The 2D image-based virtual try-on has aroused increased interest from the multimedia and computer vision fields due to its enormous commercial value. Nevertheless, most existing image-based virtual try-on approaches directly combine the person-identity representation and the in-shop clothing items without taking their mutual correlations into consideration. Moreover, these methods are commonly established on pure convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures which are not simple to capture the long-range correlations among the input pixels. As a result, it generally results in inconsistent results. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage cloth interactive transformer (CIT) method for the virtual try-on task. During the first stage, we design a CIT matching block, aiming to precisely capture the long-range correlations between the cloth-agnostic person information and the in-shop cloth information. Consequently, it makes the warped in-shop clothing items look more natural in appearance. In the second stage, we put forth a CIT reasoning block for establishing global mutual interactive dependencies among person representation, the warped clothing item, and the corresponding warped cloth mask. The empirical results, based on mutual dependencies, demonstrate that the final try-on results are more realistic. Substantial empirical results on a public fashion dataset illustrate that the suggested CIT attains competitive virtual try-on performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, Accepted by ACM ToMM in 2023</p></details> |

Given an input garment image and person video, our method aims to generate a high-quality try-on video of the person wearing the given garment, while preserving the person's identity and motion. Image-based virtual try-on has shown impressive results; however, existing video virtual try-on (VVT) methods are still lacking garment details and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based architecture for video virtual try-on, split classifier-free guidance for increased control over the conditioning inputs, and a progressive temporal training strategy for single-pass 64-frame, 512px video generation. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of joint image-video training for video try-on, especially when video data is limited. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our approach sets the new state-of-the-art for video virtual try-on.

| **[Virtual Accessory Try-On via Keypoint Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17131v1)** | 2023-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The virtual try-on task refers to fitting the clothes from one image onto another portrait image. In this paper, we focus on virtual accessory try-on, which fits accessory (e.g., glasses, ties) onto a face or portrait image. Unlike clothing try-on, which relies on human silhouette as guidance, accessory try-on warps the accessory into an appropriate location and shape to generate a plausible composite image. In contrast to previous try-on methods that treat foreground (i.e., accessories) and background (i.e., human faces or bodies) equally, we propose a background-oriented network to utilize the prior knowledge of human bodies and accessories. Specifically, our approach learns the human body priors and hallucinates the target locations of specified foreground keypoints in the background. Then our approach will inject foreground information with accessory priors into the background UNet. Based on the hallucinated target locations, the warping parameters are calculated to warp the foreground. Moreover, this background-oriented network can also easily incorporate auxiliary human face/body semantic segmentation supervision to further boost performance. Experiments conducted on STRAT dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Better Fit: Accommodate Variations in Clothing Types for Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08453v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on aims to transfer target in-shop clothing to a dressed model image, the objectives of which are totally taking off original clothing while preserving the contents outside of the try-on area, naturally wearing target clothing and correctly inpainting the gap between target clothing and original clothing. Tremendous efforts have been made to facilitate this popular research area, but cannot keep the type of target clothing with the try-on area affected by original clothing. In this paper, we focus on the unpaired virtual try-on situation where target clothing and original clothing on the model are different, i.e., the practical scenario. To break the correlation between the try-on area and the original clothing and make the model learn the correct information to inpaint, we propose an adaptive mask training paradigm that dynamically adjusts training masks. It not only improves the alignment and fit of clothing but also significantly enhances the fidelity of virtual try-on experience. Furthermore, we for the first time propose two metrics for unpaired try-on evaluation, the Semantic-Densepose-Ratio (SDR) and Skeleton-LPIPS (S-LPIPS), to evaluate the correctness of clothing type and the accuracy of clothing texture. For unpaired try-on validation, we construct a comprehensive cross-try-on benchmark (Cross-27) with distinctive clothing items and model physiques, covering a broad try-on scenarios. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, contributing to the advancement of virtual try-on technology and offering new insights and tools for future research in the field. The code, model and benchmark will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

The task requires trying on a clothing item on a target model image. An efficient framework for this is composed of two stages: (1) warping (transforming) the try-on cloth to align with the pose and shape of the target model, and (2) a texture transfer module to seamlessly integrate the warped try-on cloth onto the target model image. Existing methods suffer from artifacts and distortions in their try-on output. In this work, we present SieveNet, a framework for robust image-based virtual try-on. Firstly, we introduce a multi-stage coarse-to-fine warping network to better model fine-grained intricacies (while transforming the try-on cloth) and train it with a novel perceptual geometric matching loss. Next, we introduce a try-on cloth conditioned segmentation mask prior to improve the texture transfer network. Finally, we also introduce a dueling triplet loss strategy for training the texture translation network which further improves the quality of the generated try-on results. We present extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of each component of the proposed pipeline and show significant performance improvements against the current state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE WACV 2020</p></details> |

Directly applying the technique of image-based try-on to the video domain in a frame-wise manner will cause temporal-inconsistent outcomes while previous video-based try-on solutions can only generate low visual quality and blurring results. In this work, we present ViViD, a novel framework employing powerful diffusion models to tackle the task of video virtual try-on. Specifically, we design the Garment Encoder to extract fine-grained clothing semantic features, guiding the model to capture garment details and inject them into the target video through the proposed attention feature fusion mechanism. To ensure spatial-temporal consistency, we introduce a lightweight Pose Encoder to encode pose signals, enabling the model to learn the interactions between clothing and human posture and insert hierarchical Temporal Modules into the text-to-image stable diffusion model for more coherent and lifelike video synthesis. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset, which is the largest, with the most diverse types of garments and the highest resolution for the task of video virtual try-on to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to yield satisfactory video try-on results. The dataset, codes, and weights will be publicly available.

| **[Video Virtual Try-on with Conditional Diffusion Transformer Inpainter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21270v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Learning Garment DensePose for Robust Warping in Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.17688v1)** | 2023-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on, i.e making people virtually try new garments, is an active research area in computer vision with great commercial applications. Current virtual try-on methods usually work in a two-stage pipeline. First, the garment image is warped on the person's pose using a flow estimation network. Then in the second stage, the warped garment is fused with the person image to render a new try-on image. Unfortunately, such methods are heavily dependent on the quality of the garment warping which often fails when dealing with hard poses (e.g., a person lifting or crossing arms). In this work, we propose a robust warping method for virtual try-on based on a learned garment DensePose which has a direct correspondence with the person's DensePose. Due to the lack of annotated data, we show how to leverage an off-the-shelf person DensePose model and a pretrained flow model to learn the garment DensePose in a weakly supervised manner. The garment DensePose allows a robust warping to any person's pose without any additional computation. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art equivalent on virtual try-on benchmarks and shows warping robustness on in-the-wild person images with hard poses, making it more suited for real-world virtual try-on applications.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While existing virtual try-on models focus primarily on clothing items, there is a gap in the market for accessories. This research explores the application of techniques from 2D virtual try-on models for clothing, such as VITON-HD, and integrates them with other computer vision models, notably MediaPipe Hand Landmarker. Drawing on existing literature, the study customizes and retrains a unique model using accessory-specific data and network architecture modifications to assess the feasibility of extending virtual try-on technology to accessories. Results demonstrate improved location prediction compared to the original model for clothes, even with a small dataset. This underscores the model's potential with larger datasets exceeding 10,000 images, paving the way for future research in virtual accessory try-on applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Limb-Aware Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12588v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing image-based virtual try-on methods directly transfer specific clothing to a human image without utilizing clothing attributes to refine the transferred clothing geometry and textures, which causes incomplete and blurred clothing appearances. In addition, these methods usually mask the limb textures of the input for the clothing-agnostic person representation, which results in inaccurate predictions for human limb regions (i.e., the exposed arm skin), especially when transforming between long-sleeved and short-sleeved garments. To address these problems, we present a progressive virtual try-on framework, named PL-VTON, which performs pixel-level clothing warping based on multiple attributes of clothing and embeds explicit limb-aware features to generate photo-realistic try-on results. Specifically, we design a Multi-attribute Clothing Warping (MCW) module that adopts a two-stage alignment strategy based on multiple attributes to progressively estimate pixel-level clothing displacements. A Human Parsing Estimator (HPE) is then introduced to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and limb regions. Finally, we propose a Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) module to estimate high-quality details in limb regions by fusing textures of the clothing and the human body with the guidance of explicit limb-aware features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art virtual try-on methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, limited work has explored the task of video-based virtual try-on while it is important in real-world applications. Most existing video-based virtual try-on methods usually require clothing templates and they can only generate blurred and low-resolution results. To address these challenges, we propose a Memory-based Video virtual Try-On Network (MV-TON), which seamlessly transfers desired clothes to a target person without using any clothing templates and generates high-resolution realistic videos. Specifically, MV-TON consists of two modules: 1) a try-on module that transfers the desired clothes from model images to frame images by pose alignment and region-wise replacing of pixels; 2) a memory refinement module that learns to embed the existing generated frames into the latent space as external memory for the following frame generation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method in the video virtual try-on task and its superiority over other existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite tremendous progress of image virtual try-on, they lead to inconsistency between frames when applied to videos. Limited work also explored the task of video-based virtual try-on but failed to produce visually pleasing and temporally coherent results. Moreover, there are two other key challenges: 1) how to generate accurate warping when occlusions appear in the clothing region; 2) how to generate clothes and non-target body parts (e.g. arms, neck) in harmony with the complicated background; To address them, we propose a novel video virtual try-on framework, ClothFormer, which successfully synthesizes realistic, harmonious, and spatio-temporal consistent results in complicated environment. In particular, ClothFormer involves three major modules. First, a two-stage anti-occlusion warping module that predicts an accurate dense flow mapping between the body regions and the clothing regions. Second, an appearance-flow tracking module utilizes ridge regression and optical flow correction to smooth the dense flow sequence and generate a temporally smooth warped clothing sequence. Third, a dual-stream transformer extracts and fuses clothing textures, person features, and environment information to generate realistic try-on videos. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our method highly surpasses the baselines in terms of synthesized video quality both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2022 Oral, project page https://cloth-former.github.io</p></details> |

Existing methods commonly employ the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform in-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising performance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details, leading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as well as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed SCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb textures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and try-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we devise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow path. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's body, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and post-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance flow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results, we integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network based on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are able to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and precise control over details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Due to the strong generative power of the diffusion prior,we can generate realistic clothes shadows and wrinkles.2)Static Characteristics Transformation: High-frequency Map(HF-Map)is our fundamental insight for static representation.PLTON first warps in-shop clothes to the target model pose by a traditional warping network,and uses a high-pass filter to extract an HF-Map for preserving static cloth features.The HF-Map is used to generate modulation maps through our static extractor,which are injected into a fixed U-net to synthesize the final result.To enhance retention,a Two-stage Blended Denoising method is proposed to guide the diffusion process for correct spatial layout and color.PLTON is finetuned only with our collected small-size try-on dataset.Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on 1024 768 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework in mimicking real clothes dynamics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address this problem by finding clothing category-specific warping networks for the virtual try-on task via Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We introduce a NAS-Warping Module and elaborately design a bilevel hierarchical search space to identify the optimal network-level and operation-level flow estimation architecture. Given the network-level search space, containing different numbers of warping blocks, and the operation-level search space with different convolution operations, we jointly learn a combination of repeatable warping cells and convolution operations specifically for the clothing-person alignment. Moreover, a NAS-Fusion Module is proposed to synthesize more natural final try-on results, which is realized by leveraging particular skip connections to produce better-fused features that are required for seamlessly fusing the warped clothing and the unchanged person part. We adopt an efficient and stable one-shot searching strategy to search the above two modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our WAS-VTON significantly outperforms the previous fixed-architecture try-on methods with more natural warping results and virtual try-on results.</p></details> |  |

Existing 2D image-based virtual try-on methods aim to transfer a target clothing image onto a reference person, which has two main disadvantages: cannot control the size and length precisely; unable to accurately estimate the user's figure in the case of users wearing thick clothes, resulting in inaccurate dressing effect. In this paper, we put forward an akin task that aims to dress clothing for underwear models. %, which is also an urgent need in e-commerce scenarios. To solve the above drawbacks, we propose a Shape Controllable Virtual Try-On Network (SC-VTON), where a graph attention network integrates the information of model and clothing to generate the warped clothing image. In addition, the control points are incorporated into SC-VTON for the desired clothing shape. Furthermore, by adding a Splitting Network and a Synthesis Network, we can use clothing/model pair data to help optimize the deformation module and generalize the task to the typical virtual try-on task. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve accurate shape control.

In contrast, this paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3) integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D virtual try-on methods mainly rely on annotated 3D human shapes and garment templates, which hinders their applications in practical scenarios. 2D virtual try-on approaches provide a faster alternative to manipulate clothed humans, but lack the rich and realistic 3D representation. In this paper, we propose a novel Monocular-to-3D Virtual Try-On Network (M3D-VTON) that builds on the merits of both 2D and 3D approaches. By integrating 2D information efficiently and learning a mapping that lifts the 2D representation to 3D, we make the first attempt to reconstruct a 3D try-on mesh only taking the target clothing and a person image as inputs. The proposed M3D-VTON includes three modules: 1) The Monocular Prediction Module (MPM) that estimates an initial full-body depth map and accomplishes 2D clothes-person alignment through a novel two-stage warping procedure; 2) The Depth Refinement Module (DRM) that refines the initial body depth to produce more detailed pleat and face characteristics; 3) The Texture Fusion Module (TFM) that fuses the warped clothing with the non-target body part to refine the results. We also construct a high-quality synthesized Monocular-to-3D virtual try-on dataset, in which each person image is associated with a front and a back depth map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3D-VTON can manipulate and reconstruct the 3D human body wearing the given clothing with compelling details and is more efficient than other 3D approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2021</p></details> |

Using advanced diffusion models, DiffusionTrend harnesses latent information rich in prior information to capture the nuances of garment details. Throughout the diffusion denoising process, these details are seamlessly integrated into the model image generation, expertly directed by a precise garment mask crafted by a lightweight and compact CNN. Although our DiffusionTrend model initially demonstrates suboptimal metric performance, our exploratory approach offers some important advantages: (1) It circumvents resource-intensive retraining of diffusion models on large datasets. (2) It eliminates the necessity for various complex and user-unfriendly model inputs. (3) It delivers a visually compelling try-on experience, underscoring the potential of training-free diffusion model. This initial foray into the application of untrained diffusion models in virtual try-on technology potentially paves the way for further exploration and refinement in this industrially and academically valuable field.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAT-DM: Controllable Accelerated Virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18405v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) dominate the research field in image-based virtual try-on, but have not resolved problems such as unnatural deformation of garments and the blurry generation quality. While the generative quality of diffusion models is impressive, achieving controllability poses a significant challenge when applying it to virtual try-on and multiple denoising iterations limit its potential for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose Controllable Accelerated virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model (CAT-DM). To enhance the controllability, a basic diffusion-based virtual try-on network is designed, which utilizes ControlNet to introduce additional control conditions and improves the feature extraction of garment images. In terms of acceleration, CAT-DM initiates a reverse denoising process with an implicit distribution generated by a pre-trained GAN-based model. Compared with previous try-on methods based on diffusion models, CAT-DM not only retains the pattern and texture details of the inshop garment but also reduces the sampling steps without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CAT-DM against both GANbased and diffusion-based methods in producing more realistic images and accurately reproducing garment patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Style Virtual Try on Network for Clothing Business Industry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13183v2)** | 2021-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing development of garment manufacturing industry, the method of combining neural network with industry to reduce product redundancy has been paid more and more attention.In order to reduce garment redundancy and achieve personalized customization, more researchers have appeared in the field of virtual trying on.They try to transfer the target clothing to the reference figure, and then stylize the clothes to meet user's requirements for fashion.But the biggest problem of virtual try on is that the shape and motion blocking distort the clothes, causing the patterns and texture on the clothes to be impossible to restore. This paper proposed a new stylized virtual try on network, which can not only retain the authenticity of clothing texture and pattern, but also obtain the undifferentiated stylized try on. The network is divided into three sub-networks, the first is the user image, the front of the target clothing image, the semantic segmentation image and the posture heat map to generate a more detailed human parsing map. Second, UV position map and dense correspondence are used to map patterns and textures to the deformed silhouettes in real time, so that they can be retained in real time, and the rationality of spatial structure can be guaranteed on the basis of improving the authenticity of images. Third,Stylize and adjust the generated virtual try on image. Through the most subtle changes, users can choose the texture, color and style of clothing to improve the user's experience.</p></details> | 10 pages,9 figures |

However, virtual try-on should be a broader application that also allows customers to visualize garments on themselves using their own casual photos, known as in-the-wild try-on. Unfortunately, the existing methods, which achieve plausible results for studio try-on settings, perform poorly in the in-the-wild context. This is because these methods often require paired images (garment images paired with images of people wearing the same garment) for training. While such paired data is easy to collect from shopping websites for studio settings, it is difficult to obtain for in-the-wild scenes. In this work, we fill the gap by (1) introducing a StreetTryOn benchmark to support in-the-wild virtual try-on applications and (2) proposing a novel method to learn virtual try-on from a set of in-the-wild person images directly without requiring paired data. We tackle the unique challenges, including warping garments to more diverse human poses and rendering more complex backgrounds faithfully, by a novel DensePose warping correction method combined with diffusion-based conditional inpainting. Our experiments show competitive performance for standard studio try-on tasks and SOTA performance for street try-on and cross-domain try-on tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The abstract and intro are updated.

Prior methods successfully preserve the character of clothing images, however, occlusion remains a pernicious effect for realistic virtual try-on. In this work, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the occlusions and categorize them into two aspects: i) Inherent-Occlusion: the ghost of the former cloth still exists in the try-on image; ii) Acquired-Occlusion: the target cloth warps to the unreasonable body part. Based on the in-depth analysis, we find that the occlusions can be simulated by a novel semantically-guided mixup module, which can generate semantic-specific occluded images that work together with the try-on images to facilitate training a de-occlusion try-on (DOC-VTON) framework. Specifically, DOC-VTON first conducts a sharpened semantic parsing on the try-on person. Aided by semantics guidance and pose prior, various complexities of texture are selectively blending with human parts in a copy-and-paste manner. Then, the Generative Module (GM) is utilized to take charge of synthesizing the final try-on image and learning to de-occlusion jointly. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, DOC-VTON achieves better perceptual quality by reducing occlusion effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in IEEE T-MM; Code is available at: https://github.com/JyChen9811/DOC-VTON</p></details> |
| **[High-Fidelity Virtual Try-on with Large-Scale Unpaired Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01593v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTON) transfers a target clothing image to a reference person, where clothing fidelity is a key requirement for downstream e-commerce applications. However, existing VTON methods still fall short in high-fidelity try-on due to the conflict between the high diversity of dressing styles (\eg clothes occluded by pants or distorted by posture) and the limited paired data for training. In this work, we propose a novel framework \textbf{Boosted Virtual Try-on (BVTON)} to leverage the large-scale unpaired learning for high-fidelity try-on. Our key insight is that pseudo try-on pairs can be reliably constructed from vastly available fashion images. Specifically, \textbf{1)} we first propose a compositional canonicalizing flow that maps on-model clothes into pseudo in-shop clothes, dubbed canonical proxy. Each clothing part (sleeves, torso) is reversely deformed into an in-shop-like shape to compositionally construct the canonical proxy. \textbf{2)} Next, we design a layered mask generation module that generates accurate semantic layout by training on canonical proxy. We replace the in-shop clothes used in conventional pipelines with the derived canonical proxy to boost the training process. \textbf{3)} Finally, we propose an unpaired try-on synthesizer by constructing pseudo training pairs with randomly misaligned on-model clothes, where intricate skin texture and clothes boundaries can be generated. Extensive experiments on high-resolution ($1024\times768$) datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Notably, BVTON shows great generalizability and scalability to various dressing styles and data sources.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Significance of Anatomical Constraints in Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02110v1)** | 2024-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The system of Virtual Try-ON (VTON) allows a user to try a product virtually. In general, a VTON system takes a clothing source and a person's image to predict the try-on output of the person in the given clothing. Although existing methods perform well for simple poses, in case of bent or crossed arms posture or when there is a significant difference between the alignment of the source clothing and the pose of the target person, these methods fail by generating inaccurate clothing deformations. In the VTON methods that employ Thin Plate Spline (TPS) based clothing transformations, this mainly occurs for two reasons - (1)~the second-order smoothness constraint of TPS that restricts the bending of the object plane. (2)~Overlaps among different clothing parts (e.g., sleeves and torso) can not be modeled by a single TPS transformation, as it assumes the clothing as a single planar object; therefore, disregards the independence of movement of different clothing parts. To this end, we make two major contributions. Concerning the bending limitations of TPS, we propose a human AnaTomy-Aware Geometric (ATAG) transformation. Regarding the overlap issue, we propose a part-based warping approach that divides the clothing into independently warpable parts to warp them separately and later combine them. Extensive analysis shows the efficacy of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2208.08076</p></details> |
| **[Smart Fitting Room: A One-stop Framework for Matching-aware Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16825v2)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of virtual try-on has revolutionized online shopping by allowing customers to visualize themselves in various fashion items, thus extending the in-store try-on experience to the cyber space. Although virtual try-on has attracted considerable research initiatives, existing systems only focus on the quality of image generation, overlooking whether the fashion item is a good match to the given person and clothes. Recognizing this gap, we propose to design a one-stop Smart Fitting Room, with the novel formulation of matching-aware virtual try-on. Following this formulation, we design a Hybrid Matching-aware Virtual Try-On Framework (HMaVTON), which combines retrieval-based and generative methods to foster a more personalized virtual try-on experience. This framework integrates a hybrid mix-and-match module and an enhanced virtual try-on module. The former can recommend fashion items available on the platform to boost sales and generate clothes that meets the diverse tastes of consumers. The latter provides high-quality try-on effects, delivering a one-stop shopping service. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we enlist the expertise of fashion designers for a professional evaluation, assessing the rationality and diversity of the clothes combinations and conducting an evaluation matrix analysis. Our method significantly enhances the practicality of virtual try-on. The code is available at https://github.com/Yzcreator/HMaVTON.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods model virtual try-on as image mask-inpaint task, which requires masking the person image and results in significant loss of spatial information. Especially, for in-the-wild try-on scenarios with complex poses and occlusions, mask-based methods often introduce noticeable artifacts. Our research found that a mask-free approach can fully leverage spatial and lighting information from the original person image, enabling high-quality virtual try-on. Consequently, we propose a novel training paradigm for a mask-free try-on diffusion model. We ensure the model's mask-free try-on capability by creating high-quality pseudo-data and further enhance its handling of complex spatial information through effective in-the-wild data augmentation. Besides, a try-on localization loss is designed to concentrate on try-on area while suppressing garment features in non-try-on areas, ensuring precise rendering of garments and preservation of fore/back-ground. In the end, we introduce BooW-VTON, the mask-free virtual try-on diffusion model, which delivers SOTA try-on quality without parsing cost. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have demonstrated superior performance in wild scenarios with such a low-demand input.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer, which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Texture-Preserving Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01089v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on is an increasingly important task for online shopping. It aims to synthesize images of a specific person wearing a specified garment. Diffusion model-based approaches have recently become popular, as they are excellent at image synthesis tasks. However, these approaches usually employ additional image encoders and rely on the cross-attention mechanism for texture transfer from the garment to the person image, which affects the try-on's efficiency and fidelity. To address these issues, we propose an Texture-Preserving Diffusion (TPD) model for virtual try-on, which enhances the fidelity of the results and introduces no additional image encoders. Accordingly, we make contributions from two aspects. First, we propose to concatenate the masked person and reference garment images along the spatial dimension and utilize the resulting image as the input for the diffusion model's denoising UNet. This enables the original self-attention layers contained in the diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate texture transfer. Second, we propose a novel diffusion-based method that predicts a precise inpainting mask based on the person and reference garment images, further enhancing the reliability of the try-on results. In addition, we integrate mask prediction and image synthesis into a single compact model. The experimental results show that our approach can be applied to various try-on tasks, e.g., garment-to-person and person-to-person try-ons, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular VITON, VITON-HD databases.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[Diffusion Model-Based Size Variable Virtual Try-On Technology and Evaluation Method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00562v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of e-commerce, virtual try-on technology has become an essential tool to satisfy consumers' personalized clothing preferences. Diffusion-based virtual try-on systems aim to naturally align garments with target individuals, generating realistic and detailed try-on images. However, existing methods overlook the importance of garment size variations in meeting personalized consumer needs. To address this, we propose a novel virtual try-on method named SV-VTON, which introduces garment sizing concepts into virtual try-on tasks. The SV-VTON method first generates refined masks for multiple garment sizes, then integrates these masks with garment images at varying proportions, enabling virtual try-on simulations across different sizes. In addition, we developed a specialized size evaluation module to quantitatively assess the accuracy of size variations. This module calculates differences between generated size increments and international sizing standards, providing objective measurements of size accuracy. To further validate SV-VTON's generalization capability across different models, we conducted experiments on multiple SOTA Diffusion models. The results demonstrate that SV-VTON consistently achieves precise multi-size virtual try-on across various SOTA models, and validates the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method, significantly fulfilling users' personalized multi-size virtual try-on requirements.</p></details> |  |

An example input includes: an image of a shirt, an image of a pair of pants, "rolled sleeves, shirt tucked in", and an image of a person. The output is a visualization of how those garments (in the desired layout) would look like on the given person. Key contributions of our method are: 1) a single stage diffusion based model, with no super resolution cascading, that allows to mix and match multiple garments at 1024x512 resolution preserving and warping intricate garment details, 2) architecture design (VTO UNet Diffusion Transformer) to disentangle denoising from person specific features, allowing for a highly effective finetuning strategy for identity preservation (6MB model per individual vs 4GB achieved with, e.g., dreambooth finetuning); solving a common identity loss problem in current virtual try-on methods, 3) layout control for multiple garments via text inputs specifically finetuned over PaLI-3 for virtual try-on task.

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Most existing virtual try-on approaches rely on complex inputs such as agnostic person images, human pose, densepose, or body keypoints, making them labor-intensive and impractical for real-world applications. In contrast, EVTAR adopts a two-stage training strategy, enabling simple inference with only the source image and the target garment inputs. Our model generates try-on results without masks, densepose, or segmentation maps. Moreover, EVTAR leverages additional reference images of different individuals wearing the same clothes to preserve garment texture and fine-grained details better. This mechanism is analogous to how humans consider reference models when choosing outfits, thereby simulating a more realistic and high-quality dressing effect. We enrich the training data with supplementary references and unpaired person images to support these capabilities. We evaluate EVTAR on two widely used benchmarks and diverse tasks, and the results consistently validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Significance of Skeleton-based Features in Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08076v3)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of \textit{Virtual Try-ON} (VTON) benefits e-retailing by giving an user the convenience of trying a clothing at the comfort of their home. In general, most of the existing VTON methods produce inconsistent results when a person posing with his arms folded i.e., bent or crossed, wants to try an outfit. The problem becomes severe in the case of long-sleeved outfits. As then, for crossed arm postures, overlap among different clothing parts might happen. The existing approaches, especially the warping-based methods employing \textit{Thin Plate Spline (TPS)} transform can not tackle such cases. To this end, we attempt a solution approach where the clothing from the source person is segmented into semantically meaningful parts and each part is warped independently to the shape of the person. To address the bending issue, we employ hand-crafted geometric features consistent with human body geometry for warping the source outfit. In addition, we propose two learning-based modules: a synthesizer network and a mask prediction network. All these together attempt to produce a photo-realistic, pose-robust VTON solution without requiring any paired training data. Comparison with some of the benchmark methods clearly establishes the effectiveness of the approach.</p></details> |  |

Our method emphasizes detail enhancement by contrasting local clothing image embeddings, generated by ViT, with their global counterparts. Techniques such as conditional guidance and focus on key regions have been integrated into our approach.

Instead, we present a novel virtual Try-On network, M2E-Try On Net, which transfers the clothes from a model image to a person image without the need of any clean product images. To obtain a realistic image of person wearing the desired model clothes, we aim to solve the following challenges: 1) non-rigid nature of clothes - we need to align poses between the model and the user; 2) richness in textures of fashion items - preserving the fine details and characteristics of the clothes is critical for photo-realistic transfer; 3) variation of identity appearances - it is required to fit the desired model clothes to the person identity seamlessly. To tackle these challenges, we introduce three key components, including the pose alignment network (PAN), the texture refinement network (TRN) and the fitting network (FTN). Since it is unlikely to gather image pairs of input person image and desired output image (i.e. person wearing the desired clothes), our framework is trained in a self-supervised manner to gradually transfer the poses and textures of the model's clothes to the desired appearance. In the experiments, we verify on the Deep Fashion dataset and MVC dataset that our method can generate photo-realistic images for the person to try-on the model clothes. Furthermore, we explore the model capability for different fashion items, including both upper and lower garments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.11026v1)** | 2019-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on system under arbitrary human poses has huge application potential, yet raises quite a lot of challenges, e.g. self-occlusions, heavy misalignment among diverse poses, and diverse clothes textures. Existing methods aim at fitting new clothes into a person can only transfer clothes on the fixed human pose, but still show unsatisfactory performances which often fail to preserve the identity, lose the texture details, and decrease the diversity of poses. In this paper, we make the first attempt towards multi-pose guided virtual try-on system, which enables transfer clothes on a person image under diverse poses. Given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and a desired pose, the proposed Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-on Network (MG-VTON) can generate a new person image after fitting the desired clothes into the input image and manipulating human poses. Our MG-VTON is constructed in three stages: 1) a desired human parsing map of the target image is synthesized to match both the desired pose and the desired clothes shape; 2) a deep Warping Generative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) warps the desired clothes appearance into the synthesized human parsing map and alleviates the misalignment problem between the input human pose and desired human pose; 3) a refinement render utilizing multi-pose composition masks recovers the texture details of clothes and removes some artifacts. Extensive experiments on well-known datasets and our newly collected largest virtual try-on benchmark demonstrate that our MG-VTON significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively with promising multi-pose virtual try-on performances.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Per Garment Capture and Synthesis for Real-time Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04654v1)** | 2021-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on is a promising application of computer graphics and human computer interaction that can have a profound real-world impact especially during this pandemic. Existing image-based works try to synthesize a try-on image from a single image of a target garment, but it inherently limits the ability to react to possible interactions. It is difficult to reproduce the change of wrinkles caused by pose and body size change, as well as pulling and stretching of the garment by hand. In this paper, we propose an alternative per garment capture and synthesis workflow to handle such rich interactions by training the model with many systematically captured images. Our workflow is composed of two parts: garment capturing and clothed person image synthesis. We designed an actuated mannequin and an efficient capturing process that collects the detailed deformations of the target garments under diverse body sizes and poses. Furthermore, we proposed to use a custom-designed measurement garment, and we captured paired images of the measurement garment and the target garments. We then learn a mapping between the measurement garment and the target garments using deep image-to-image translation. The customer can then try on the target garments interactively during online shopping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to UIST2021.

| **[SPG-VTON: Semantic Prediction Guidance for Multi-pose Virtual Try-on](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01578v2)** | 2022-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on is challenging in fitting a target in-shop clothes into a reference person under diverse human poses. Previous works focus on preserving clothing details ( e.g., texture, logos, patterns ) when transferring desired clothes onto a target person under a fixed pose. However, the performances of existing methods significantly dropped when extending existing methods to multi-pose virtual try-on. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Semantic Prediction Guidance multi-pose Virtual Try-On Network (SPG-VTON), which could fit the desired clothing into a reference person under arbitrary poses. Concretely, SPG-VTON is composed of three sub-modules. First, a Semantic Prediction Module (SPM) generates the desired semantic map. The predicted semantic map provides more abundant guidance to locate the desired clothes region and produce a coarse try-on image. Second, a Clothes Warping Module (CWM) warps in-shop clothes to the desired shape according to the predicted semantic map and the desired pose. Specifically, we introduce a conductible cycle consistency loss to alleviate the misalignment in the clothes warping process. Third, a Try-on Synthesis Module (TSM) combines the coarse result and the warped clothes to generate the final virtual try-on image, preserving details of the desired clothes and under the desired pose. Besides, we introduce a face identity loss to refine the facial appearance and maintain the identity of the final virtual try-on result at the same time. We evaluate the proposed method on the most massive multi-pose dataset (MPV) and the DeepFashion dataset. The qualitative and quantitative experiments show that SPG-VTON is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to the data noise, including background and accessory changes, i.e., hats and handbags, showing good scalability to the real-world scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-Based Animation of Clothing for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07190v1)** | 2019-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a learning-based clothing animation method for highly efficient virtual try-on simulation. Given a garment, we preprocess a rich database of physically-based dressed character simulations, for multiple body shapes and animations. Then, using this database, we train a learning-based model of cloth drape and wrinkles, as a function of body shape and dynamics. We propose a model that separates global garment fit, due to body shape, from local garment wrinkles, due to both pose dynamics and body shape. We use a recurrent neural network to regress garment wrinkles, and we achieve highly plausible nonlinear effects, in contrast to the blending artifacts suffered by previous methods. At runtime, dynamic virtual try-on animations are produced in just a few milliseconds for garments with thousands of triangles. We show qualitative and quantitative analysis of results</p></details> | Eurographics 2019 |
| **[Toward Characteristic-Preserving Image-based Virtual Try-On Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07688v3)** | 2018-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on systems for fitting new in-shop clothes into a person image have attracted increasing research attention, yet is still challenging. A desirable pipeline should not only transform the target clothes into the most fitting shape seamlessly but also preserve well the clothes identity in the generated image, that is, the key characteristics (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) that depict the original clothes. However, previous image-conditioned generation works fail to meet these critical requirements towards the plausible virtual try-on performance since they fail to handle large spatial misalignment between the input image and target clothes. Prior work explicitly tackled spatial deformation using shape context matching, but failed to preserve clothing details due to its coarse-to-fine strategy. In this work, we propose a new fully-learnable Characteristic-Preserving Virtual Try-On Network(CP-VTON) for addressing all real-world challenges in this task. First, CP-VTON learns a thin-plate spline transformation for transforming the in-shop clothes into fitting the body shape of the target person via a new Geometric Matching Module (GMM) rather than computing correspondences of interest points as prior works did. Second, to alleviate boundary artifacts of warped clothes and make the results more realistic, we employ a Try-On Module that learns a composition mask to integrate the warped clothes and the rendered image to ensure smoothness. Extensive experiments on a fashion dataset demonstrate our CP-VTON achieves the state-of-the-art virtual try-on performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2018</p></details> |
| **[Dress Code: High-Resolution Multi-Category Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08532v2)** | 2022-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on strives to transfer the appearance of a clothing item onto the image of a target person. Prior work focuses mainly on upper-body clothes (e.g. t-shirts, shirts, and tops) and neglects full-body or lower-body items. This shortcoming arises from a main factor: current publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on do not account for this variety, thus limiting progress in the field. To address this deficiency, we introduce Dress Code, which contains images of multi-category clothes. Dress Code is more than 3x larger than publicly available datasets for image-based virtual try-on and features high-resolution paired images (1024x768) with front-view, full-body reference models. To generate HD try-on images with high visual quality and rich in details, we propose to learn fine-grained discriminating features. Specifically, we leverage a semantic-aware discriminator that makes predictions at pixel-level instead of image- or patch-level. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach surpasses the baselines and state-of-the-art competitors in terms of visual quality and quantitative results. The Dress Code dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/dress-code.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2022 - Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr6TW3uTHG4</p></details> |
| **[Improving Diffusion Models for Authentic Virtual Try-on in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05139v3)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers image-based virtual try-on, which renders an image of a person wearing a curated garment, given a pair of images depicting the person and the garment, respectively. Previous works adapt existing exemplar-based inpainting diffusion models for virtual try-on to improve the naturalness of the generated visuals compared to other methods (e.g., GAN-based), but they fail to preserve the identity of the garments. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model that improves garment fidelity and generates authentic virtual try-on images. Our method, coined IDM-VTON, uses two different modules to encode the semantics of garment image; given the base UNet of the diffusion model, 1) the high-level semantics extracted from a visual encoder are fused to the cross-attention layer, and then 2) the low-level features extracted from parallel UNet are fused to the self-attention layer. In addition, we provide detailed textual prompts for both garment and person images to enhance the authenticity of the generated visuals. Finally, we present a customization method using a pair of person-garment images, which significantly improves fidelity and authenticity. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches (both diffusion-based and GAN-based) in preserving garment details and generating authentic virtual try-on images, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the proposed customization method demonstrates its effectiveness in a real-world scenario.

| **[VTBench: Comprehensive Benchmark Suite Towards Real-World Virtual Try-on Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19571v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While virtual try-on has achieved significant progress, evaluating these models towards real-world scenarios remains a challenge. A comprehensive benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability, and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario, VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols, generated results, and human annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Websit: \url{https://github.com/HUuxiaobin/VTBench}</p></details> |
| **[ACDG-VTON: Accurate and Contained Diffusion Generation for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13951v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Try-on (VTON) involves generating images of a person wearing selected garments. Diffusion-based methods, in particular, can create high-quality images, but they struggle to maintain the identities of the input garments. We identified this problem stems from the specifics in the training formulation for diffusion. To address this, we propose a unique training scheme that limits the scope in which diffusion is trained. We use a control image that perfectly aligns with the target image during training. In turn, this accurately preserves garment details during inference. We demonstrate our method not only effectively conserves garment details but also allows for layering, styling, and shoe try-on. Our method runs multi-garment try-on in a single inference cycle and can support high-quality zoomed-in generations without training in higher resolutions. Finally, we show our method surpasses prior methods in accuracy and quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present IPVTON, a novel image-based 3D virtual try-on framework. IPVTON employs score distillation sampling with image prompts to optimize a hybrid 3D human representation, integrating target garment features into diffusion priors through an image prompt adapter. To avoid interference with non-target areas, we leverage mask-guided image prompt embeddings to focus the image features on the try-on regions. Moreover, we impose geometric constraints on the 3D model with a pseudo silhouette generated by ControlNet, ensuring that the clothed 3D human model retains the shape of the source identity while accurately wearing the target garments. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that IPVTON outperforms previous methods in image-based 3D virtual try-on tasks, excelling in both geometry and texture.</p></details> |  |

Conditioned upon a new clothing-agnostic yet descriptive person representation, our framework first generates a coarse synthesized image with the target clothing item overlaid on that same person in the same pose. We further enhance the initial blurry clothing area with a refinement network. The network is trained to learn how much detail to utilize from the target clothing item, and where to apply to the person in order to synthesize a photo-realistic image in which the target item deforms naturally with clear visual patterns. Experiments on our newly collected Zalando dataset demonstrate its promise in the image-based virtual try-on task over state-of-the-art generative models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing techniques are currently still limited in the quality of the try-on results they are able to produce from input images of diverse characteristics. In this work, we propose a Context-Driven Virtual Try-On Network (C-VTON) that addresses these limitations and convincingly transfers selected clothing items to the target subjects even under challenging pose configurations and in the presence of self-occlusions. At the core of the C-VTON pipeline are: (i) a geometric matching procedure that efficiently aligns the target clothing with the pose of the person in the input images, and (ii) a powerful image generator that utilizes various types of contextual information when synthesizing the final try-on result. C-VTON is evaluated in rigorous experiments on the VITON and MPV datasets and in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to produce photo-realistic and visually convincing results and significantly improves on the existing state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2022</p></details> |

However, presenting the three-dimensional (3D) physical characteristic (e.g., pleat and shadow) based on a 2D image is very challenging. Although there have been several previous studies on 2D-based virtual try-on work, most 1) required user-specified target poses that are not user-friendly and may not be the best for the target clothing, and 2) failed to address some problematic cases, including facial details, clothing wrinkles and body occlusions. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose an innovative template-free try-on image synthesis (TF-TIS) network. The TF-TIS first synthesizes the target pose according to the user-specified in-shop clothing. Afterward, given an in-shop clothing image, a user image, and a synthesized pose, we propose a novel model for synthesizing a human try-on image with the target clothing in the best fitting pose. The qualitative and quantitative experiments both indicate that the proposed TF-TIS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially for difficult cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TNNLS (2021). 14 pages including 2 pages of reference</p></details> |

To alleviate these issues caused by the diffusion stochastic nature and latent supervision, we propose a novel Faithful Latent Diffusion Model for VTON, termed FLDM-VTON. FLDM-VTON improves the conventional latent diffusion process in three major aspects. First, we propose incorporating warped clothes as both the starting point and local condition, supplying the model with faithful clothes priors. Second, we introduce a novel clothes flattening network to constrain generated try-on images, providing clothes-consistent faithful supervision. Third, we devise a clothes-posterior sampling for faithful inference, further enhancing the model performance over conventional clothes-agnostic Gaussian sampling. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets demonstrate that our FLDM-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is able to generate photo-realistic try-on images with faithful clothing details.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Parser-Free Virtual Try-on via Distilling Appearance Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04559v2)** | 2021-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image virtual try-on aims to fit a garment image (target clothes) to a person image. Prior methods are heavily based on human parsing. However, slightly-wrong segmentation results would lead to unrealistic try-on images with large artifacts. Inaccurate parsing misleads parser-based methods to produce visually unrealistic results where artifacts usually occur. A recent pioneering work employed knowledge distillation to reduce the dependency of human parsing, where the try-on images produced by a parser-based method are used as supervisions to train a "student" network without relying on segmentation, making the student mimic the try-on ability of the parser-based model. However, the image quality of the student is bounded by the parser-based model. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach, "teacher-tutor-student" knowledge distillation, which is able to produce highly photo-realistic images without human parsing, possessing several appealing advantages compared to prior arts. (1) Unlike existing work, our approach treats the fake images produced by the parser-based method as "tutor knowledge", where the artifacts can be corrected by real "teacher knowledge", which is extracted from the real person images in a self-supervised way. (2) Other than using real images as supervisions, we formulate knowledge distillation in the try-on problem as distilling the appearance flows between the person image and the garment image, enabling us to find accurate dense correspondences between them to produce high-quality results. (3) Extensive evaluations show large superiority of our method (see Fig. 1).</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2021 |
| **[MC-VTON: Minimal Control Virtual Try-On Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03630v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic try-on effects. They use an extra reference network or an additional image encoder to process multiple conditional image inputs, which adds complexity pre-processing and additional computational costs. Besides, they require more than 25 inference steps, bringing longer inference time. In this work, with the development of diffusion transformer (DiT), we rethink the necessity of additional reference network or image encoder and introduce MC-VTON, which leverages DiT's intrinsic backbone to seamlessly integrate minimal conditional try-on inputs. Compared to existing methods, the superiority of MC-VTON is demonstrated in four aspects: (1) Superior detail fidelity. Our DiT-based MC-VTON exhibits superior fidelity in preserving fine-grained details. (2) Simplified network and inputs. We remove any extra reference network or image encoder. We also remove unnecessary conditions like the long prompt, pose estimation, human parsing, and depth map. We require only the masked person image and the garment image. (3) Parameter-efficient training. To process the try-on task, we fine-tune the FLUX.1-dev with only 39.7M additional parameters (0.33% of the backbone parameters). (4) Less inference steps. We apply distillation diffusion on MC-VTON and only need 8 steps to generate a realistic try-on image, with only 86.8M additional parameters (0.72% of the backbone parameters). Experiments show that MC-VTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer condition inputs, trainable parameters, and inference steps than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shining Yourself: High-Fidelity Ornaments Virtual Try-on with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16065v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While virtual try-on for clothes and shoes with diffusion models has gained attraction, virtual try-on for ornaments, such as bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, remains largely unexplored. Due to the intricate tiny patterns and repeated geometric sub-structures in most ornaments, it is much more difficult to guarantee identity and appearance consistency under large pose and scale variances between ornaments and models. This paper proposes the task of virtual try-on for ornaments and presents a method to improve the geometric and appearance preservation of ornament virtual try-ons. Specifically, we estimate an accurate wearing mask to improve the alignments between ornaments and models in an iterative scheme alongside the denoising process. To preserve structure details, we further regularize attention layers to map the reference ornament mask to the wearing mask in an implicit way. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully wears ornaments from reference images onto target models, handling substantial differences in scale and pose while preserving identity and achieving realistic visual effects.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we take a step forwards to explore versatile virtual try-on solutions, which we argue should possess three main properties, namely, they should support unsupervised training, arbitrary garment categories, and controllable garment editing. To this end, we propose a characteristic-preserving end-to-end network, the PAtch-routed SpaTially-Adaptive GAN++ (PASTA-GAN++), to achieve a versatile system for high-resolution unpaired virtual try-on. Specifically, our PASTA-GAN++ consists of an innovative patch-routed disentanglement module to decouple the intact garment into normalized patches, which is capable of retaining garment style information while eliminating the garment spatial information, thus alleviating the overfitting issue during unsupervised training. Furthermore, PASTA-GAN++ introduces a patch-based garment representation and a patch-guided parsing synthesis block, allowing it to handle arbitrary garment categories and support local garment editing. Finally, to obtain try-on results with realistic texture details, PASTA-GAN++ incorporates a novel spatially-adaptive residual module to inject the coarse warped garment feature into the generator. Extensive experiments on our newly collected UnPaired virtual Try-on (UPT) dataset demonstrate the superiority of PASTA-GAN++ over existing SOTAs and its ability for controllable garment editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2111.10544</p></details> |
| **[PG-VTON: A Novel Image-Based Virtual Try-On Method via Progressive Inference Paradigm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08956v2)** | 2023-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on is a promising computer vision topic with a high commercial value wherein a new garment is visually worn on a person with a photo-realistic effect. Previous studies conduct their shape and content inference at one stage, employing a single-scale warping mechanism and a relatively unsophisticated content inference mechanism. These approaches have led to suboptimal results in terms of garment warping and skin reservation under challenging try-on scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel virtual try-on method via progressive inference paradigm (PGVTON) that leverages a top-down inference pipeline and a general garment try-on strategy. Specifically, we propose a robust try-on parsing inference method by disentangling semantic categories and introducing consistency. Exploiting the try-on parsing as the shape guidance, we implement the garment try-on via warping-mapping-composition. To facilitate adaptation to a wide range of try-on scenarios, we adopt a covering more and selecting one warping strategy and explicitly distinguish tasks based on alignment. Additionally, we regulate StyleGAN2 to implement re-naked skin inpainting, conditioned on the target skin shape and spatial-agnostic skin features. Experiments demonstrate that our method has state-of-the-art performance under two challenging scenarios. The code will be available at https://github.com/NerdFNY/PGVTON.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks.

However, existing methods solely focus on the frontal try-on using the frontal clothing. When the views of the clothing and person are significantly inconsistent, particularly when the person's view is non-frontal, the results are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-View Virtual Try-ON (MV-VTON), which aims to reconstruct the dressing results from multiple views using the given clothes. Given that single-view clothes provide insufficient information for MV-VTON, we instead employ two images, i.e., the frontal and back views of the clothing, to encompass the complete view as much as possible. Moreover, we adopt diffusion models that have demonstrated superior abilities to perform our MV-VTON. In particular, we propose a view-adaptive selection method where hard-selection and soft-selection are applied to the global and local clothing feature extraction, respectively. This ensures that the clothing features are roughly fit to the person's view. Subsequently, we suggest joint attention blocks to align and fuse clothing features with person features. Additionally, we collect a MV-VTON dataset MVG, in which each person has multiple photos with diverse views and poses. Experiments show that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on MV-VTON task using our MVG dataset, but also has superiority on frontal-view virtual try-on task using VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by AAAI 2025.

However, to achieve high-fidelity try-on performance, most state-of-the-art methods still rely on accurate segmentation masks, which are often produced by near-perfect parsers or manual labeling. To overcome the bottleneck, we propose a parser-free virtual try-on method based on the diffusion model (PFDM). Given two images, PFDM can "wear" garments on the target person seamlessly by implicitly warping without any other information. To learn the model effectively, we synthesize many pseudo-images and construct sample pairs by wearing various garments on persons. Supervised by the large-scale expanded dataset, we fuse the person and garment features using a proposed Garment Fusion Attention (GFA) mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed PFDM can successfully handle complex cases, synthesize high-fidelity images, and outperform both state-of-the-art parser-free and parser-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICASSP 2024</p></details> |

Recent works in virtual clothing try-on feature a plethora of possible architectural and data representation choices. However, they present little clarity on quantifying the isolated visual effect of each choice, nor do they specify the hyperparameter details that are key to experimental reproduction. Our work, ShineOn, approaches the try-on task from a bottom-up approach and aims to shine light on the visual and quantitative effects of each experiment. We build a series of scientific experiments to isolate effective design choices in video synthesis for virtual clothing try-on. Specifically, we investigate the effect of different pose annotations, self-attention layer placement, and activation functions on the quantitative and qualitative performance of video virtual try-on. We find that DensePose annotations not only enhance face details but also decrease memory usage and training time. Next, we find that attention layers improve face and neck quality. Finally, we show that GELU and ReLU activation functions are the most effective in our experiments despite the appeal of newer activations such as Swish and Sine. We will release a well-organized code base, hyperparameters, and model checkpoints to support the reproducibility of our results. We expect our extensive experiments and code to greatly inform future design choices in video virtual try-on.

In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO image conditioning. To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories, demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset spanning thousands of product categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |
| **[Arbitrary Virtual Try-On Network: Characteristics Preservation and Trade-off between Body and Clothing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12346v1)** | 2021-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based virtual try-on system has achieved some encouraging progress recently, but there still remain several big challenges that need to be solved, such as trying on arbitrary clothes of all types, trying on the clothes from one category to another and generating image-realistic results with few artifacts. To handle this issue, we in this paper first collect a new dataset with all types of clothes, \ie tops, bottoms, and whole clothes, each one has multiple categories with rich information of clothing characteristics such as patterns, logos, and other details. Based on this dataset, we then propose the Arbitrary Virtual Try-On Network (AVTON) that is utilized for all-type clothes, which can synthesize realistic try-on images by preserving and trading off characteristics of the target clothes and the reference person. Our approach includes three modules: 1) Limbs Prediction Module, which is utilized for predicting the human body parts by preserving the characteristics of the reference person. This is especially good for handling cross-category try-on task (\eg long sleeves \(\leftrightarrow\) short sleeves or long pants \(\leftrightarrow\) skirts, \etc), where the exposed arms or legs with the skin colors and details can be reasonably predicted; 2) Improved Geometric Matching Module, which is designed to warp clothes according to the geometry of the target person. We improve the TPS based warping method with a compactly supported radial function (Wendland's \(Ψ\)-function); 3) Trade-Off Fusion Module, which is to trade off the characteristics of the warped clothes and the reference person. This module is to make the generated try-on images look more natural and realistic based on a fine-tune symmetry of the network structure. Extensive simulations are conducted and our approach can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art virtual try-on methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interacting Multiple Try Algorithms with Different Proposal Distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.1170v1)** | 2014-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new class of interacting Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms designed for increasing the efficiency of a modified multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) algorithm. The extension with respect to the existing MCMC literature is twofold. The sampler proposed extends the basic MTM algorithm by allowing different proposal distributions in the multiple-try generation step. We exploit the structure of the MTM algorithm with different proposal distributions to naturally introduce an interacting MTM mechanism (IMTM) that expands the class of population Monte Carlo methods. We show the validity of the algorithm and discuss the choice of the selection weights and of the different proposals. We provide numerical studies which show that the new algorithm can perform better than the basic MTM algorithm and that the interaction mechanism allows the IMTM to efficiently explore the state space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Undress to Redress: A Training-Free Framework for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07680v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos. Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority'' completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an ''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment, effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps. Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[MGT: Extending Virtual Try-Off to Multi-Garment Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13078v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision is transforming fashion industry through Virtual Try-On (VTON) and Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF). VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, in contrast, extracts standardized garment images from photos of clothed individuals. We introduce Multi-Garment TryOffDiff (MGT), a diffusion-based VTOFF model capable of handling diverse garment types, including upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. MGT builds on a latent diffusion architecture with SigLIP-based image conditioning to capture garment characteristics such as shape, texture, and pattern. To address garment diversity, MGT incorporates class-specific embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art VTOFF results on VITON-HD and competitive performance on DressCode. When paired with VTON models, it further enhances p2p-VTON by reducing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin tone, ensuring preservation of person-specific characteristics.

To address this potential weakness, we propose a fill in fabrics (FIFA) model, a self-supervised conditional generative adversarial network based framework comprised of a Fabricator and a unified virtual try-on pipeline with a Segmenter, Warper and Fuser. The Fabricator aims to reconstruct the clothing image when provided with a masked clothing as input, and learns the overall structure of the clothing by filling in fabrics. A virtual try-on pipeline is then trained by transferring the learned representations from the Fabricator to Warper in an effort to warp and refine the target clothing. We also propose to use a multi-scale structural constraint to enforce global context at multiple scales while warping the target clothing to better fit the pose and shape of the person. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FIFA model achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard VITON dataset for virtual try-on of clothing items, and is shown to be effective at handling complex poses and retaining the texture and embroidery of the clothing.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved perceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details such as logos and printed text elements that are critical for brand integrity and customer trust. In this work, we propose DualFit, a hybrid VTON pipeline that addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage, DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned flow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a fidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the warped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this process, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly around garment seams. Extensive qualitative results show that DualFit achieves visually seamless try-on results while faithfully maintaining high-frequency garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy and perceptual realism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Retai...</summary><p>Retail Vision, ICCV 2025</p></details> |

One of them is selected according to certain weights and then it is tested according to a suitable acceptance probability. Clearly, since the computational cost increases as the employed number of tries grows, one expects that the performance of an MTM scheme improves as the number of tries increases, as well. However, there are scenarios where the increase of number of tries does not produce a corresponding enhancement of the performance. In this work, we describe these scenarios and then we introduce possible solutions for solving these issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClothFit: Cloth-Human-Attribute Guided Virtual Try-On Network Using 3D Simulated Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.13908v1)** | 2023-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online clothing shopping has become increasingly popular, but the high rate of returns due to size and fit issues has remained a major challenge. To address this problem, virtual try-on systems have been developed to provide customers with a more realistic and personalized way to try on clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel virtual try-on method called ClothFit, which can predict the draping shape of a garment on a target body based on the actual size of the garment and human attributes. Unlike existing try-on models, ClothFit considers the actual body proportions of the person and available cloth sizes for clothing virtualization, making it more appropriate for current online apparel outlets. The proposed method utilizes a U-Net-based network architecture that incorporates cloth and human attributes to guide the realistic virtual try-on synthesis. Specifically, we extract features from a cloth image using an auto-encoder and combine them with features from the user's height, weight, and cloth size. The features are concatenated with the features from the U-Net encoder, and the U-Net decoder synthesizes the final virtual try-on image. Our experimental results demonstrate that ClothFit can significantly improve the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of photo-realistic virtual try-on results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Image Processing 2023 (ICIP 2023)</p></details> |

To improve customers' experience in online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for outfit retrieval, recommendation, and try-on. We explore two approaches for outfit retrieval: similar item retrieval and text feedback-guided item retrieval. Notably, we introduce a novel transformer architecture designed to recommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the customers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for retailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and provide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results of our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive system highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientVITON: An Efficient Virtual Try-On Model using Optimized Diffusion Process](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11776v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Would not it be much more convenient for everybody to try on clothes by only looking into a mirror ? The answer to that problem is virtual try-on, enabling users to digitally experiment with outfits. The core challenge lies in realistic image-to-image translation, where clothing must fit diverse human forms, poses, and figures. Early methods, which used 2D transformations, offered speed, but image quality was often disappointing and lacked the nuance of deep learning. Though GAN-based techniques enhanced realism, their dependence on paired data proved limiting. More adaptable methods offered great visuals but demanded significant computing power and time. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for high-fidelity translation, yet the current crop of virtual try-on tools still struggle with detail loss and warping issues. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes EfficientVITON, a new virtual try-on system leveraging the impressive pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for better images and deployment feasibility. The system includes a spatial encoder to maintain clothings finer details and zero cross-attention blocks to capture the subtleties of how clothes fit a human body. Input images are carefully prepared, and the diffusion process has been tweaked to significantly cut generation time without image quality loss. The training process involves two distinct stages of fine-tuning, carefully incorporating a balance of loss functions to ensure both accurate try-on results and high-quality visuals. Rigorous testing on the VITON-HD dataset, supplemented with real-world examples, has demonstrated that EfficientVITON achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 7 pages |

The primary difficulty arises from the absence of human-like reasoning, which involves addressing size mismatches between garments and models while recognizing and leveraging the distinct functionalities of various regions within the model images. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from human cognitive processes and disentangle the complex reasoning required for cross-category try-on into a structured framework. This framework systematically decomposes the model image into three distinct regions: try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones. Each zone plays a specific role in accommodating the garment and facilitating realistic synthesis. To endow the model with robust reasoning capabilities for cross-category scenarios, we propose an iterative data constructor. This constructor encompasses diverse scenarios, including intra-category try-on, any-to-dress transformations (replacing any garment category with a dress), and dress-to-any transformations (replacing a dress with another garment category). Utilizing the generated dataset, we introduce a tri-zone priors generator that intelligently predicts the try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones by analyzing how the input garment is expected to align with the model image. Guided by these tri-zone priors, our proposed method, CrossVTON, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, it demonstrates superior capability in handling cross-category virtual try-on, meeting the complex demands of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25749v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis, preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions. However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation, leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, existing research has primarily overlooked a crucial aspect - the runtime of the underlying machine-learning model. While existing methods prioritize enhancing output quality, they often disregard the execution time, which restricts their applications on a limited range of devices. To address this gap, we propose Distilled Mobile Real-time Virtual Try-On (DM-VTON), a novel virtual try-on framework designed to achieve simplicity and efficiency. Our approach is based on a knowledge distillation scheme that leverages a strong Teacher network as supervision to guide a Student network without relying on human parsing. Notably, we introduce an efficient Mobile Generative Module within the Student network, significantly reducing the runtime while ensuring high-quality output. Additionally, we propose Virtual Try-on-guided Pose for Data Synthesis to address the limited pose variation observed in training images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve 40 frames per second on a single Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU and only take up 37 MB of memory while producing almost the same output quality as other state-of-the-art methods. DM-VTON stands poised to facilitate the advancement of real-time AR applications, in addition to the generation of lifelike attired human figures tailored for diverse specialized training tasks. https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia/research/DMVTON</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISMAR 2023 (Poster paper)</p></details> |

We leverage the power of pretrained latent diffusion models, designing an outfitting UNet to learn the garment detail features. Without a redundant warping process, the garment features are precisely aligned with the target human body via the proposed outfitting fusion in the self-attention layers of the denoising UNet. In order to further enhance the controllability, we introduce outfitting dropout to the training process, which enables us to adjust the strength of the garment features through classifier-free guidance. Our comprehensive experiments on the VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets demonstrate that OOTDiffusion efficiently generates high-quality try-on results for arbitrary human and garment images, which outperforms other VTON methods in both realism and controllability, indicating an impressive breakthrough in virtual try-on.

| **[Single Stage Virtual Try-on via Deformable Attention Flows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.09161v1)** | 2022-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on aims to generate a photo-realistic fitting result given an in-shop garment and a reference person image. Existing methods usually build up multi-stage frameworks to deal with clothes warping and body blending respectively, or rely heavily on intermediate parser-based labels which may be noisy or even inaccurate. To solve the above challenges, we propose a single-stage try-on framework by developing a novel Deformable Attention Flow (DAFlow), which applies the deformable attention scheme to multi-flow estimation. With pose keypoints as the guidance only, the self- and cross-deformable attention flows are estimated for the reference person and the garment images, respectively. By sampling multiple flow fields, the feature-level and pixel-level information from different semantic areas are simultaneously extracted and merged through the attention mechanism. It enables clothes warping and body synthesizing at the same time which leads to photo-realistic results in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on two try-on datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, additional experiments on the other two image editing tasks illustrate the versatility of our method for multi-view synthesis and image animation.</p></details> | ECCV 2022 |
| **[Enhancing Virtual Try-On with Synthetic Pairs and Error-Aware Noise Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04666v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an isolated garment image in a canonical product view and a separate image of a person, the virtual try-on task aims to generate a new image of the person wearing the target garment. Prior virtual try-on works face two major challenges in achieving this goal: a) the paired (human, garment) training data has limited availability; b) generating textures on the human that perfectly match that of the prompted garment is difficult, often resulting in distorted text and faded textures. Our work explores ways to tackle these issues through both synthetic data as well as model refinement. We introduce a garment extraction model that generates (human, synthetic garment) pairs from a single image of a clothed individual. The synthetic pairs can then be used to augment the training of virtual try-on. We also propose an Error-Aware Refinement-based Schrödinger Bridge (EARSB) that surgically targets localized generation errors for correcting the output of a base virtual try-on model. To identify likely errors, we propose a weakly-supervised error classifier that localizes regions for refinement, subsequently augmenting the Schrödinger Bridge's noise schedule with its confidence heatmap. Experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode-Upper demonstrate that our synthetic data augmentation enhances the performance of prior work, while EARSB improves the overall image quality. In user studies, our model is preferred by the users in an average of 59% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To solve the task, the existing methods warp the clothing item to fit the person's body and generate the segmentation map of the person wearing the item before fusing the item with the person. However, when the warping and the segmentation generation stages operate individually without information exchange, the misalignment between the warped clothes and the segmentation map occurs, which leads to the artifacts in the final image. The information disconnection also causes excessive warping near the clothing regions occluded by the body parts, so-called pixel-squeezing artifacts. To settle the issues, we propose a novel try-on condition generator as a unified module of the two stages (i.e., warping and segmentation generation stages). A newly proposed feature fusion block in the condition generator implements the information exchange, and the condition generator does not create any misalignment or pixel-squeezing artifacts. We also introduce discriminator rejection that filters out the incorrect segmentation map predictions and assures the performance of virtual try-on frameworks. Experiments on a high-resolution dataset demonstrate that our model successfully handles the misalignment and occlusion, and significantly outperforms the baselines.

| **[A Two-stage Personalized Virtual Try-on Framework with Shape Control and Texture Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15480v1)** | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Diffusion model has a strong ability to generate wild images. However, the model can just generate inaccurate images with the guidance of text, which makes it very challenging to directly apply the text-guided generative model for virtual try-on scenarios. Taking images as guiding conditions of the diffusion model, this paper proposes a brand new personalized virtual try-on model (PE-VITON), which uses the two stages (shape control and texture guidance) to decouple the clothing attributes. Specifically, the proposed model adaptively matches the clothing to human body parts through the Shape Control Module (SCM) to mitigate the misalignment of the clothing and the human body parts. The semantic information of the input clothing is parsed by the Texture Guided Module (TGM), and the corresponding texture is generated by directional guidance. Therefore, this model can effectively solve the problems of weak reduction of clothing folds, poor generation effect under complex human posture, blurred edges of clothing, and unclear texture styles in traditional try-on methods. Meanwhile, the model can automatically enhance the generated clothing folds and textures according to the human posture, and improve the authenticity of virtual try-on. In this paper, qualitative and quantitative experiments are carried out on high-resolution paired and unpaired datasets, the results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model.</p></details> |  |
| **[DS-VTON: An Enhanced Dual-Scale Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00908v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures and patterns. These two requirements map directly onto a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, where the coarse stage handles structural alignment and the fine stage recovers rich garment details. Motivated by this observation, we propose DS-VTON, an enhanced dual-scale coarse-to-fine framework that tackles the try-on problem more effectively. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment. In the second stage, a blend-refine diffusion process reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between scales through noise-image blending, emphasizing texture fidelity and effectively correcting fine-detail errors from the low-resolution stage. In addition, our method adopts a fully mask-free generation strategy, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or segmentation masks. Extensive experiments show that DS-VTON not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but consistently and significantly surpasses prior methods in both structural alignment and texture fidelity across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Photo-Realistic Virtual Try-On by Adaptively Generating$\leftrightarrow$Preserving Image Content](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05863v1)** | 2020-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image visual try-on aims at transferring a target clothing image onto a reference person, and has become a hot topic in recent years. Prior arts usually focus on preserving the character of a clothing image (e.g. texture, logo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains a big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions and human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating and Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic layout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g. long sleeve shirt$\rightarrow$arm, arm$\rightarrow$jacket), and then determines whether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the predicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothing details. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout generation module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to progressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a clothes warping module warps clothing images according to the generated semantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to stabilize the warping process during training. Third, an inpainting module for content fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic layout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body. In comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate photo-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer fine-details.</p></details> | CVPR 2020 |

Though MLLMs have shown promising results in numerous high-level vision and vision-language tasks such as VQA and text-to-image, no works have demonstrated how low-level vision tasks can benefit from MLLMs. We find that most current MLLMs are blind to low-level features due to their design of vision modules, thus are inherently incapable for solving low-level vision tasks. In this work, we purpose $\textbf{LM4LV}$, a framework that enables a FROZEN LLM to solve a range of low-level vision tasks without any multi-modal data or prior. This showcases the LLM's strong potential in low-level vision and bridges the gap between MLLMs and low-level vision tasks.

| **[Revisiting Implicit Neural Representations in Low-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10250v1)** | 2023-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been emerging in computer vision in recent years. It has been shown to be effective in parameterising continuous signals such as dense 3D models from discrete image data, e.g. the neural radius field (NeRF). However, INR is under-explored in 2D image processing tasks. Considering the basic definition and the structure of INR, we are interested in its effectiveness in low-level vision problems such as image restoration. In this work, we revisit INR and investigate its application in low-level image restoration tasks including image denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and deblurring. Extensive experimental evaluations suggest the superior performance of INR in several low-level vision tasks with limited resources, outperforming its counterparts by over 2dB.

These problems usually involve the estimation of two components of the target signals: structures and details. Motivated by this, our proposed DualCNN consists of two parallel branches, which respectively recovers the structures and details in an end-to-end manner. The recovered structures and details can generate the target signals according to the formation model for each particular application. The DualCNN is a flexible framework for low-level vision tasks and can be easily incorporated into existing CNNs. Experimental results show that the DualCNN can be effectively applied to numerous low-level vision tasks with favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2018 |

Among them, diffusion model-based solutions, characterized by a forward diffusion process and a reverse denoising process, have emerged as widely acclaimed for their ability to produce samples of superior quality and diversity. This ensures the generation of visually compelling results with intricate texture information. Despite their remarkable success, a noticeable gap exists in a comprehensive survey that amalgamates these pioneering diffusion model-based works and organizes the corresponding threads. This paper proposes the comprehensive review of diffusion model-based techniques. We present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks and explore their correlations with other deep generative models, establishing the theoretical foundation. Following this, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models, considering both the underlying framework and the target task. Additionally, we summarize extended diffusion models applied in other tasks, including medical, remote sensing, and video scenarios. Moreover, we provide an overview of commonly used benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We conduct a thorough evaluation, encompassing both performance and efficiency, of diffusion model-based techniques in three prominent tasks. Finally, we elucidate the limitations of current diffusion models and propose seven intriguing directions for future research. This comprehensive examination aims to facilitate a profound understanding of the landscape surrounding denoising diffusion models in the context of low-level vision tasks.

Researchers in computer vision have worked extensively on this problem, in which the goal is to partition (or segment) an image into regions that are homogeneous or uniform in some sense. This segmentation is often utilized by some higher level process, such as an object recognition system. We show that by considering uncertainty in a Bayesian formalism, we can use statistical image models to build an approximate representation of a probability distribution over a space of alternative segmentations. We give detailed descriptions of the various levels of uncertainty associated with this problem, discuss the interaction of prior and posterior distributions, and provide the operations for constructing this representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of the Ninth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1993)</p></details> |
| **[Interpreting Low-level Vision Models with Causal Effect Maps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19789v3)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of low-level vision tasks but also increased the difficulty of interpretability. A deep understanding of deep models is beneficial for both network design and practical reliability. To take up this challenge, we introduce causality theory to interpret low-level vision models and propose a model-/task-agnostic method called Causal Effect Map (CEM). With CEM, we can visualize and quantify the input-output relationships on either positive or negative effects. After analyzing various low-level vision tasks with CEM, we have reached several interesting insights, such as: (1) Using more information of input images (e.g., larger receptive field) does NOT always yield positive outcomes. (2) Attempting to incorporate mechanisms with a global receptive field (e.g., channel attention) into image denoising may prove futile. (3) Integrating multiple tasks to train a general model could encourage the network to prioritize local information over global context. Based on the causal effect theory, the proposed diagnostic tool can refresh our common knowledge and bring a deeper understanding of low-level vision models. Codes are available at https://github.com/J-FHu/CEM.</p></details> |  |

We replace the heuristic regularization term with a learnable subspace constraint, and preserve the data term to exploit domain knowledge derived from the first principle of a task. This learning subspace minimization (LSM) framework unifies the network structures and the parameters for many low-level vision tasks, which allows us to train a single network for multiple tasks simultaneously with completely shared parameters, and even generalizes the trained network to an unseen task as long as its data term can be formulated. We demonstrate our LSM framework on four low-level tasks including interactive image segmentation, video segmentation, stereo matching, and optical flow, and validate the network on various datasets. The experiments show that the proposed LSM generates state-of-the-art results with smaller model size, faster training convergence, and real-time inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at CVPR2020</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Scalable Unified Modeling for General Low-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14801v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lumina-OmniLV: A Unified Multimodal Framework for General Low-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04903v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Lunima-OmniLV (abbreviated as OmniLV), a universal multimodal multi-task framework for low-level vision that addresses over 100 sub-tasks across four major categories: image restoration, image enhancement, weak-semantic dense prediction, and stylization. OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoMAE: Low-level Vision Masked Autoencoders for Low-dose CT Denoising](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12405v1)** | 2023-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) offers reduced X-ray radiation exposure but at the cost of compromised image quality, characterized by increased noise and artifacts. Recently, transformer models emerged as a promising avenue to enhance LDCT image quality. However, the success of such models relies on a large amount of paired noisy and clean images, which are often scarce in clinical settings. In the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, masked autoencoders (MAE) have been recognized as an effective label-free self-pretraining method for transformers, due to their exceptional feature representation ability. However, the original pretraining and fine-tuning design fails to work in low-level vision tasks like denoising. In response to this challenge, we redesign the classical encoder-decoder learning model and facilitate a simple yet effective low-level vision MAE, referred to as LoMAE, tailored to address the LDCT denoising problem. Moreover, we introduce an MAE-GradCAM method to shed light on the latent learning mechanisms of the MAE/LoMAE. Additionally, we explore the LoMAE's robustness and generability across a variety of noise levels. Experiments results show that the proposed LoMAE can enhance the transformer's denoising performance and greatly relieve the dependence on the ground truth clean data. It also demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalizability over a spectrum of noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating COPY-BLEND Augmentation for Low Level Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05889v1)** | 2021-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Region modification-based data augmentation techniques have shown to improve performance for high level vision tasks (object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification, etc.) by encouraging underlying algorithms to focus on multiple discriminative features. However, as these techniques destroy spatial relationship with neighboring regions, performance can be deteriorated when using them to train algorithms designed for low level vision tasks (low light image enhancement, image dehazing, deblurring, etc.) where textural consistency between recovered and its neighboring regions is important to ensure effective performance. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of a simple copy-blend data augmentation technique that copies patches from noisy images and blends onto a clean image and vice versa to ensure that an underlying algorithm localizes and recovers affected regions resulting in increased perceptual quality of a recovered image. To assess performance improvement, we perform extensive experiments alongside different region modification-based augmentation techniques and report observations such as improved performance, reduced requirement for training dataset, and early convergence across tasks such as low light image enhancement, image dehazing and image deblurring without any modification to baseline algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual MAE for Image Manipulation Localization: A High-level Vision Learner Focusing on Low-level Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06525v1)** | 2023-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, multimedia forensics faces unprecedented challenges due to the rapid advancement of multimedia generation technology thereby making Image Manipulation Localization (IML) crucial in the pursuit of truth. The key to IML lies in revealing the artifacts or inconsistencies between the tampered and authentic areas, which are evident under pixel-level features. Consequently, existing studies treat IML as a low-level vision task, focusing on allocating tampered masks by crafting pixel-level features such as image RGB noises, edge signals, or high-frequency features. However, in practice, tampering commonly occurs at the object level, and different classes of objects have varying likelihoods of becoming targets of tampering. Therefore, object semantics are also vital in identifying the tampered areas in addition to pixel-level features. This necessitates IML models to carry out a semantic understanding of the entire image. In this paper, we reformulate the IML task as a high-level vision task that greatly benefits from low-level features. Based on such an interpretation, we propose a method to enhance the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) by incorporating high-resolution inputs and a perceptual loss supervision module, which is termed Perceptual MAE (PMAE). While MAE has demonstrated an impressive understanding of object semantics, PMAE can also compensate for low-level semantics with our proposed enhancements. Evidenced by extensive experiments, this paradigm effectively unites the low-level and high-level features of the IML task and outperforms state-of-the-art tampering localization methods on all five publicly available datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning A Low-Level Vision Generalist via Visual Task Prompt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08601v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a unified model for general low-level vision tasks holds significant research and practical value. Current methods encounter several critical issues. Multi-task restoration approaches can address multiple degradation-to-clean restoration tasks, while their applicability to tasks with different target domains (e.g., image stylization) is limited. Methods like PromptGIP can handle multiple input-target domains but rely on the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) paradigm. Consequently, they are tied to the ViT architecture, resulting in suboptimal image reconstruction quality. In addition, these methods are sensitive to prompt image content and often struggle with low-frequency information processing. In this paper, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework to overcome these challenges. VPIP employs visual task prompts to manage tasks with different input-target domains and allows flexible selection of backbone network suitable for general tasks. Besides, a new prompt cross-attention is introduced to facilitate interaction between the input and prompt information. Based on the VPIP framework, we train a low-level vision generalist model, namely GenLV, on 30 diverse tasks. Experimental results show that GenLV can successfully address a variety of low-level tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Low-level Vision by Consensus in a Spatial Hierarchy of Regions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4894v2)** | 2015-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a multi-scale framework for low-level vision, where the goal is estimating physical scene values from image data---such as depth from stereo image pairs. The framework uses a dense, overlapping set of image regions at multiple scales and a "local model," such as a slanted-plane model for stereo disparity, that is expected to be valid piecewise across the visual field. Estimation is cast as optimization over a dichotomous mixture of variables, simultaneously determining which regions are inliers with respect to the local model (binary variables) and the correct co-ordinates in the local model space for each inlying region (continuous variables). When the regions are organized into a multi-scale hierarchy, optimization can occur in an efficient and parallel architecture, where distributed computational units iteratively perform calculations and share information through sparse connections between parents and children. The framework performs well on a standard benchmark for binocular stereo, and it produces a distributional scene representation that is appropriate for combining with higher-level reasoning and other low-level cues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2015.

| **[Revisiting the Generalization Problem of Low-level Vision Models Through the Lens of Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12600v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization remains a significant challenge for low-level vision models, which often struggle with unseen degradations in real-world scenarios despite their success in controlled benchmarks. In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in low-level vision models. Image deraining is selected as a case study due to its well-defined and easily decoupled structure, allowing for more effective observation and analysis. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that the generalization issue is not primarily due to limited network capacity but rather the failure of existing training strategies, which leads networks to overfit specific degradation patterns. Our findings show that guiding networks to focus on learning the underlying image content, rather than the degradation patterns, is key to improving generalization. We demonstrate that balancing the complexity of background images and degradations in the training data helps networks better fit the image distribution. Furthermore, incorporating content priors from pre-trained generative models significantly enhances generalization. Experiments on both image deraining and image denoising validate the proposed strategies. We believe the insights and solutions will inspire further research and improve the generalization of low-level vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.15134</p></details> |

However, perception studies suggest that humans employ object-level reasoning when judging if a particular pixel is a boundary. Inspired by this observation, in this work we show how to predict boundaries by exploiting object-level features from a pretrained object-classification network. Our method can be viewed as a "High-for-Low" approach where high-level object features inform the low-level boundary detection process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on an established boundary detection benchmark and it is efficient to run. Additionally, we show that due to the semantic nature of our boundaries we can use them to aid a number of high-level vision tasks. We demonstrate that using our boundaries we improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods on the problems of semantic boundary labeling, semantic segmentation and object proposal generation. We can view this process as a "Low-for-High" scheme, where low-level boundaries aid high-level vision tasks. Thus, our contributions include a boundary detection system that is accurate, efficient, generalizes well to multiple datasets, and is also shown to improve existing state-of-the-art high-level vision methods on three distinct tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Attention Networks for Low-Level Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.12377v3)** | 2021-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task in which an agent needs to follow a language-specified path to reach a target destination. The goal gets even harder as the actions available to the agent get simpler and move towards low-level, atomic interactions with the environment. This setting takes the name of low-level VLN. In this paper, we strive for the creation of an agent able to tackle three key issues: multi-modality, long-term dependencies, and adaptability towards different locomotive settings. To that end, we devise "Perceive, Transform, and Act" (PTA): a fully-attentive VLN architecture that leaves the recurrent approach behind and the first Transformer-like architecture incorporating three different modalities - natural language, images, and low-level actions for the agent control. In particular, we adopt an early fusion strategy to merge lingual and visual information efficiently in our encoder. We then propose to refine the decoding phase with a late fusion extension between the agent's history of actions and the perceptual modalities. We experimentally validate our model on two datasets: PTA achieves promising results in low-level VLN on R2R and achieves good performance in the recently proposed R4R benchmark.

Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing models assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution (LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal, restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://github.com/CMLab-Korea/Awesome-3D-Low-Level-Vision</p></details> |

In this paper, we tailor transformer-based pre-training regimes that boost various low-level tasks. To comprehensively diagnose the influence of pre-training, we design a whole set of principled evaluation tools that uncover its effects on internal representations. The observations demonstrate that pre-training plays strikingly different roles in low-level tasks. For example, pre-training introduces more local information to higher layers in super-resolution (SR), yielding significant performance gains, while pre-training hardly affects internal feature representations in denoising, resulting in limited gains. Further, we explore different methods of pre-training, revealing that multi-related-task pre-training is more effective and data-efficient than other alternatives. Finally, we extend our study to varying data scales and model sizes, as well as comparisons between transformers and CNNs-based architectures. Based on the study, we successfully develop state-of-the-art models for multiple low-level tasks. Code is released at https://github.com/fenglinglwb/EDT.</p></details> |  |
| **[LL-ICM: Image Compression for Low-level Machine Vision via Large Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03841v1)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Compression for Machines (ICM) aims to compress images for machine vision tasks rather than human viewing. Current works predominantly concentrate on high-level tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation. However, the quality of original images is usually not guaranteed in the real world, leading to even worse perceptual quality or downstream task performance after compression. Low-level (LL) machine vision models, like image restoration models, can help improve such quality, and thereby their compression requirements should also be considered. In this paper, we propose a pioneered ICM framework for LL machine vision tasks, namely LL-ICM. By jointly optimizing compression and LL tasks, the proposed LL-ICM not only enriches its encoding ability in generalizing to versatile LL tasks but also optimizes the processing ability of down-stream LL task models, achieving mutual adaptation for image codecs and LL task models. Furthermore, we integrate large-scale vision-language models into the LL-ICM framework to generate more universal and distortion-robust feature embeddings for LL vision tasks. Therefore, one LL-ICM codec can generalize to multiple tasks. We establish a solid benchmark to evaluate LL-ICM, which includes extensive objective experiments by using both full and no-reference image quality assessments. Experimental results show that LL-ICM can achieve 22.65% BD-rate reductions over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding.

Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing the abilities of MLLMs on low-level visual perception and understanding. To address this gap, we present Q-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visual perception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality assessment. a) To evaluate the low-level perception ability, we construct the LLVisionQA dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equipped with a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes. We then measure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. b) To examine the description ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose the LLDescribe dataset consisting of long expert-labelled golden low-level text descriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline between outputs of MLLMs and the golden descriptions. c) Besides these two tasks, we further measure their visual quality assessment ability to align with human opinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enables MLLMs to predict quantifiable quality scores, and evaluate them on various existing image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across the three abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visual skills. However, these skills are still unstable and relatively imprecise, indicating the need for specific enhancements on MLLMs towards these abilities. We hope that our benchmark can encourage the research community to delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of MLLMs. Project Page: https://q-future.github.io/Q-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 tables, with updated results</p></details> |

However, evaluating MLLMs in low-level visual perception and understanding remains a yet-to-explore domain. To this end, we design benchmark settings to emulate human language responses related to low-level vision: the low-level visual perception (A1) via visual question answering related to low-level attributes (e.g. clarity, lighting); and the low-level visual description (A2), on evaluating MLLMs for low-level text descriptions. Furthermore, given that pairwise comparison can better avoid ambiguity of responses and has been adopted by many human experiments, we further extend the low-level perception-related question-answering and description evaluations of MLLMs from single images to image pairs. Specifically, for perception (A1), we carry out the LLVisionQA+ dataset, comprising 2,990 single images and 1,999 image pairs each accompanied by an open-ended question about its low-level features; for description (A2), we propose the LLDescribe+ dataset, evaluating MLLMs for low-level descriptions on 499 single images and 450 pairs. Additionally, we evaluate MLLMs on assessment (A3) ability, i.e. predicting score, by employing a softmax-based approach to enable all MLLMs to generate quantifiable quality ratings, tested against human opinions in 7 image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. With 24 MLLMs under evaluation, we demonstrate that several MLLMs have decent low-level visual competencies on single images, but only GPT-4V exhibits higher accuracy on pairwise comparisons than single image evaluations (like humans). We hope that our benchmark will motivate further research into uncovering and enhancing these nascent capabilities of MLLMs. Datasets will be available at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.14181</p></details> |
| **[Optimization-Inspired Learning with Architecture Augmentations and Control Mechanisms for Low-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05435v2)** | 2023-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in combining learnable modules with numerical optimization to solve low-level vision tasks. However, most existing approaches focus on designing specialized schemes to generate image/feature propagation. There is a lack of unified consideration to construct propagative modules, provide theoretical analysis tools, and design effective learning mechanisms. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a unified optimization-inspired learning framework to aggregate Generative, Discriminative, and Corrective (GDC for short) principles with strong generalization for diverse optimization models. Specifically, by introducing a general energy minimization model and formulating its descent direction from different viewpoints (i.e., in a generative manner, based on the discriminative metric and with optimality-based correction), we construct three propagative modules to effectively solve the optimization models with flexible combinations. We design two control mechanisms that provide the non-trivial theoretical guarantees for both fully- and partially-defined optimization formulations. Under the support of theoretical guarantees, we can introduce diverse architecture augmentation strategies such as normalization and search to ensure stable propagation with convergence and seamlessly integrate the suitable modules into the propagation respectively. Extensive experiments across varied low-level vision tasks validate the efficacy and adaptability of GDC.

There are many computer vision tasks that work best with a linear image state, such as image deblurring and image dehazing. Unfortunately, the vast majority of images are saved in the nonlinear image state. Because of this, a number of methods have been proposed to "unprocess" nonlinear images back to a raw-RGB state. However, existing unprocessing methods have a drawback because raw-RGB images are sensor-specific. As a result, it is necessary to know which camera produced the sRGB output and use a method or network tailored for that sensor to properly unprocess it. This paper addresses this limitation by exploiting another camera image state that is not available as an output, but it is available inside the camera pipeline. In particular, cameras apply a colorimetric conversion step to convert the raw-RGB image to a device-independent space based on the CIE XYZ color space before they apply the nonlinear photo-finishing. Leveraging this canonical image state, we propose a deep learning framework, CIE XYZ Net, that can unprocess a nonlinear image back to the canonical CIE XYZ image. This image can then be processed by any low-level computer vision operator and re-rendered back to the nonlinear image. We demonstrate the usefulness of the CIE XYZ Net on several low-level vision tasks and show significant gains that can be obtained by this processing framework. Code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/mahmoudnafifi/CIE_XYZ_NET.</p></details> |  |

While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICNSLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Low-Rank Adaptation in Vision: Exploring Head-Level Responsiveness across Diverse Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08894v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has shifted the paradigm of adapting pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT), achieving great efficiency by updating only a subset of tailored parameters to approximate weight updates. However, the multi-head design of the self-attention mechanism, with the heads working in parallel in the computation flow, exhibiting similar visual patterns and requiring update over all of them, incurs unnecessary storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Head-level responsiveness tuning for low-rank adaptation (Heart-LoRA). The proposed method explores redundancy among the heads and selectively activates task-responsive heads, thus enabling fine-grained head-level tuning. Additionally, given the different responsiveness of heads to diverse visual tasks, our proposed method dynamically activates a subset of the approximated heads that are tailored to the current task. Experimental results show that Heart-LoRA yields superior performance over state-of-the-art PETL approaches on visual adaptation benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, two main problems still need to be solved: task-specific algorithms make it difficult to integrate them into a single neural network architecture, and large amounts of parameters make it difficult to achieve real-time inference. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel network, SYENet, with only $~$6K parameters, to handle multiple low-level vision tasks on mobile devices in a real-time manner. The SYENet consists of two asymmetrical branches with simple building blocks. To effectively connect the results by asymmetrical branches, a Quadratic Connection Unit(QCU) is proposed. Furthermore, to improve performance, a new Outlier-Aware Loss is proposed to process the image. The proposed method proves its superior performance with the best PSNR as compared with other networks in real-time applications such as Image Signal Processing(ISP), Low-Light Enhancement(LLE), and Super-Resolution(SR) with 2K60FPS throughput on Qualcomm 8 Gen 1 mobile SoC(System-on-Chip). Particularly, for ISP task, SYENet got the highest score in MAI 2022 Learned Smartphone ISP challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do image and video quality metrics model low-level human vision?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16264v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image and video quality metrics, such as SSIM, LPIPS, and VMAF, are aimed to predict the perceived quality of the evaluated content and are often claimed to be "perceptual". Yet, few metrics directly model human visual perception, and most rely on hand-crafted formulas or training datasets to achieve alignment with perceptual data. In this paper, we propose a set of tests for full-reference quality metrics that examine their ability to model several aspects of low-level human vision: contrast sensitivity, contrast masking, and contrast matching. The tests are meant to provide additional scrutiny for newly proposed metrics. We use our tests to analyze 33 existing image and video quality metrics and find their strengths and weaknesses, such as the ability of LPIPS and MS-SSIM to predict contrast masking and poor performance of VMAF in this task. We further find that the popular SSIM metric overemphasizes differences in high spatial frequencies, but its multi-scale counterpart, MS-SSIM, addresses this shortcoming. Such findings cannot be easily made using existing evaluation protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMLT: Low-to-high Multi-Level Vision Transformer for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03516v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision Transformer (ViT)-based methods for Image Super-Resolution have demonstrated impressive performance. However, they suffer from significant complexity, resulting in high inference times and memory usage. Additionally, ViT models using Window Self-Attention (WSA) face challenges in processing regions outside their windows. To address these issues, we propose the Low-to-high Multi-Level Transformer (LMLT), which employs attention with varying feature sizes for each head. LMLT divides image features along the channel dimension, gradually reduces spatial size for lower heads, and applies self-attention to each head. This approach effectively captures both local and global information. By integrating the results from lower heads into higher heads, LMLT overcomes the window boundary issues in self-attention. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly reduces inference time and GPU memory usage while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art ViT-based Image Super-Resolution methods. Our codes are availiable at https://github.com/jwgdmkj/LMLT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Transformer using Low-level Chest X-ray Feature Corpus for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Severity Quantification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07235v1)** | 2021-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a robust algorithm to diagnose and quantify the severity of COVID-19 using Chest X-ray (CXR) requires a large number of well-curated COVID-19 datasets, which is difficult to collect under the global COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, CXR data with other findings are abundant. This situation is ideally suited for the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, where a lot of unlabeled data can be used through structural modeling by the self-attention mechanism. However, the use of existing ViT is not optimal, since feature embedding through direct patch flattening or ResNet backbone in the standard ViT is not intended for CXR. To address this problem, here we propose a novel Vision Transformer that utilizes low-level CXR feature corpus obtained from a backbone network that extracts common CXR findings. Specifically, the backbone network is first trained with large public datasets to detect common abnormal findings such as consolidation, opacity, edema, etc. Then, the embedded features from the backbone network are used as corpora for a Transformer model for the diagnosis and the severity quantification of COVID-19. We evaluate our model on various external test datasets from totally different institutions to evaluate the generalization capability. The experimental results confirm that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in both diagnosis and severity quantification tasks with superior generalization capability, which are sine qua non of widespread deployment.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In robotic grasping, estimating the reflectance of objects is crucial for successful grasping, as it significantly impacts the distance measured by proximity sensors. We investigate whether LLMs can estimate reflectance from object names alone, leveraging the embedded human knowledge in distributional semantics, and if the latent structure of language in VLMs positively affects image-based reflectance estimation. In this paper, we verify that 1) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can estimate an object's reflectance using only text as input; and 2) VLMs such as CLIP can increase their generalization capabilities in reflectance estimation from images. Our experiments show that GPT-4 can estimate an object's reflectance using only text input with a mean error of 14.7%, lower than the image-only ResNet. Moreover, CLIP achieved the lowest mean error of 11.8%, while GPT-3.5 obtained a competitive 19.9% compared to ResNet's 17.8%. These results suggest that the distributional semantics in LLMs and VLMs increases their generalization capabilities, and the knowledge acquired by VLMs benefits from the latent structure of language.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Advanced Robotics Special Issue on Real-World Robot Applications of the Foundation Models</p></details> |

Such a universal network can act like a `swiss knife' for vision tasks; we call this architecture an UberNet to indicate its overarching nature. We address two main technical challenges that emerge when broadening up the range of tasks handled by a single CNN: (i) training a deep architecture while relying on diverse training sets and (ii) training many (potentially unlimited) tasks with a limited memory budget. Properly addressing these two problems allows us to train accurate predictors for a host of tasks, without compromising accuracy. Through these advances we train in an end-to-end manner a CNN that simultaneously addresses (a) boundary detection (b) normal estimation (c) saliency estimation (d) semantic segmentation (e) human part segmentation (f) semantic boundary detection, (g) region proposal generation and object detection. We obtain competitive performance while jointly addressing all of these tasks in 0.7 seconds per frame on a single GPU.

The transform is similar to the $unsharp$ transform but the difference from the local mean is quantised to 3 values (dark-neutral-light). The transform naturally leads to the definition of an appropriate local scale. A range of methods for extracting shape features form the transformed image are presented. The generalized feature provides a robust basis for establishing correspondence between images. The transform readily admits more complicated kernel behaviour including multi-scale and asymmetric elements to prefer shorter scale or oriented local features.</p></details> | 12 pages 8 figure |
| **[An End-to-End Cascaded Image Deraining and Object Detection Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11279v1)** | 2022-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the deep learning-based image deraining methods have made great progress in recent years, there are two major shortcomings in their application in real-world situations. Firstly, the gap between the low-level vision task represented by rain removal and the high-level vision task represented by object detection is significant, and the low-level vision task can hardly contribute to the high-level vision task. Secondly, the quality of the deraining dataset needs to be improved. In fact, the rain lines in many baselines have a large gap with the real rain lines, and the resolution of the deraining dataset images is generally not ideally. Meanwhile, there are few common datasets for both the low-level vision task and the high-level vision task. In this paper, we explore the combination of the low-level vision task with the high-level vision task. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end object detection network for reducing the impact of rainfall, which consists of two cascaded networks, an improved image deraining network and an object detection network, respectively. We also design the components of the loss function to accommodate the characteristics of the different sub-networks. We then propose a dataset based on the KITTI dataset for rainfall removal and object detection, on which our network surpasses the state-of-the-art with a significant improvement in metrics. Besides, our proposed network is measured on driving videos collected by self-driving vehicles and shows positive results for rain removal and object detection.</p></details> |  |

An object is defined as a structural element of an image, so that, an image is regarded as a maximal object. The simulating of none-hierarchical optimal pixel clustering by hierarchical clustering is studied.

A single model that reasons about it should be able to solve several such tasks well. Yet, most state-of-the-art methods rely on architectures specialized for the task at hand. We present L4P, a feedforward, general-purpose architecture that solves low-level 4D perception tasks in a unified framework. L4P leverages a pre-trained ViT-based video encoder and combines it with per-task heads that are lightweight and therefore do not require extensive training. Despite its general and feedforward formulation, our method is competitive with existing specialized methods on both dense tasks, such as depth or optical flow estimation, and sparse tasks, such as 2D/3D tracking. Moreover, it solves all tasks at once in a time comparable to that of single-task methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing techniques primarily focus on designing task-specific and data-dependent vision models on the standard RGB domain, which inherently contain latent data associations. In this study, we propose a generic low-light vision solution by introducing a generative block to convert data from the RAW to the RGB domain. This novel approach connects diverse vision problems by explicitly depicting data generation, which is the first in the field. To precisely characterize the latent correspondence between the generative procedure and the vision task, we establish a bilevel model with the parameters of the generative block defined as the upper level and the parameters of the vision task defined as the lower level. We further develop two types of learning strategies targeting different goals, namely low cost and high accuracy, to acquire a new bilevel generative learning paradigm. The generative blocks embrace a strong generalization ability in other low-light vision tasks through the bilevel optimization on enhancement tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations on three representative low-light vision tasks, namely enhancement, detection, and segmentation, fully demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach.

Recently, masked autoencoders (MAE) for feature pre-training have further unleashed the potential of Transformers, leading to state-of-the-art performances on various high-level vision tasks. However, the significance of MAE pre-training on low-level vision tasks has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we show that masked autoencoders are also scalable self-supervised learners for image processing tasks. We first present an efficient Transformer model considering both channel attention and shifted-window-based self-attention termed CSformer. Then we develop an effective MAE architecture for image processing (MAEIP) tasks. Extensive experimental results show that with the help of MAEIP pre-training, our proposed CSformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image processing tasks, including Gaussian denoising, real image denoising, single-image motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and image deraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let Segment Anything Help Image Dehaze](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15870v1)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The large language model and high-level vision model have achieved impressive performance improvements with large datasets and model sizes. However, low-level computer vision tasks, such as image dehaze and blur removal, still rely on a small number of datasets and small-sized models, which generally leads to overfitting and local optima. Therefore, we propose a framework to integrate large-model prior into low-level computer vision tasks. Just as with the task of image segmentation, the degradation of haze is also texture-related. So we propose to detect gray-scale coding, network channel expansion, and pre-dehaze structures to integrate large-model prior knowledge into any low-level dehazing network. We demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of large models in guiding low-level visual tasks through different datasets and algorithms comparison experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of grayscale coding, network channel expansion, and recurrent network structures through ablation experiments. Under the conditions where additional data and training resources are not required, we successfully prove that the integration of large-model prior knowledge will improve the dehaze performance and save training time for low-level visual tasks.</p></details> |  |

Although many works have been designed for low-light enhancement or domain adaptive machine analytics, the former considers less on high-level vision, while the latter neglects the potential of image-level signal adjustment. How to restore underexposed images/videos from the perspective of machine vision has long been overlooked. In this paper, we are the first to propose a learnable illumination enhancement model for high-level vision. Inspired by real camera response functions, we assume that the illumination enhancement function should be a concave curve, and propose to satisfy this concavity through discrete integral. With the intention of adapting illumination from the perspective of machine vision without task-specific annotated data, we design an asymmetric cross-domain self-supervised training strategy. Our model architecture and training designs mutually benefit each other, forming a powerful unsupervised normal-to-low light adaptation framework. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing low-light enhancement and adaptation methods and shows superior generalization on various low-light vision tasks, including classification, detection, action recognition, and optical flow estimation.

The primary goal of LLIE is to generate clearer images that are more visually pleasing to humans. However, the impact of LLIE methods in high-level vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection, which rely on high-quality image datasets, is not well {explored}. To explore the impact, we comprehensively evaluate LLIE methods on these high-level vision tasks by utilizing an empirical investigation comprising image classification and object detection experiments. The evaluation reveals a dichotomy: {\textit{While Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods enhance human visual interpretation, their effect on computer vision tasks is inconsistent and can sometimes be harmful. }} Our findings suggest a disconnect between image enhancement for human visual perception and for machine analysis, indicating a need for LLIE methods tailored to support high-level vision tasks effectively. This insight is crucial for the development of LLIE techniques that align with the needs of both human and machine vision.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |

The emergence of Vision Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba (EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Co-VisiON: Co-Visibility ReasONing on Sparse Image Sets of Indoor Scenes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16805v3)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans exhibit a remarkable ability to recognize co-visibility-the 3D regions simultaneously visible in multiple images-even when these images are sparsely distributed across a complex scene. This ability is foundational to 3D vision, robotic perception, and relies not only on low-level feature matching but also on high-level spatial reasoning and cognitive integration. Yet, it remains unclear whether current vision models can replicate this human-level proficiency. In this work, we introduce the Co-VisiON benchmark, designed to evaluate human-inspired co-visibility reasoning across more than 1,000 sparse-view indoor scenarios. Our results show that while co-visibility is often approached as a low-level feature-matching task, it remains challenging for existing vision models under sparse conditions. Notably, a proprietary vision-language model surpasses all vision-only baselines, but all models fall significantly short of human performance. This gap underscores the limitations of current architectures and motivates the need for models that integrate spatial and semantic information in a human-like manner. Inspired by human visual cognition, we propose a novel multi-view baseline, Covis, which achieves top performance among pure vision models and narrows the gap to the proprietary VLM. We hope our benchmark and findings will spur further advancements in developing vision models capable of robust, cognitively inspired reasoning in challenging, sparse environments.

| **[LeVERB: Humanoid Whole-Body Control with Latent Vision-Language Instruction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13751v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong semantic understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet most existing systems assume an accurate low-level controller with hand-crafted action "vocabulary" such as end-effector pose or root velocity. This assumption confines prior work to quasi-static tasks and precludes the agile, whole-body behaviors required by humanoid whole-body control (WBC) tasks. To capture this gap in the literature, we start by introducing the first sim-to-real-ready, vision-language, closed-loop benchmark for humanoid WBC, comprising over 150 tasks from 10 categories. We then propose LeVERB: Latent Vision-Language-Encoded Robot Behavior, a hierarchical latent instruction-following framework for humanoid vision-language WBC, the first of its kind. At the top level, a vision-language policy learns a latent action vocabulary from synthetically rendered kinematic demonstrations; at the low level, a reinforcement-learned WBC policy consumes these latent verbs to generate dynamics-level commands. In our benchmark, LeVERB can zero-shot attain a 80% success rate on simple visual navigation tasks, and 58.5% success rate overall, outperforming naive hierarchical whole-body VLA implementation by 7.8 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ember-lab-berkeley.github.io/LeVERB-Website/</p></details> |
| **[DRL: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Robot Control -- Concept, Literature, and Future](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13806v1)** | 2021-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combination of machine learning (for generating machine intelligence), computer vision (for better environment perception), and robotic systems (for controlled environment interaction) motivates this work toward proposing a vision-based learning framework for intelligent robot control as the ultimate goal (vision-based learning robot). This work specifically introduces deep reinforcement learning as the the learning framework, a General-purpose framework for AI (AGI) meaning application-independent and platform-independent. In terms of robot control, this framework is proposing specifically a high-level control architecture independent of the low-level control, meaning these two required level of control can be developed separately from each other. In this aspect, the high-level control creates the required intelligence for the control of the platform using the recorded low-level controlling data from that same platform generated by a trainer. The recorded low-level controlling data is simply indicating the successful and failed experiences or sequences of experiments conducted by a trainer using the same robotic platform. The sequences of the recorded data are composed of observation data (input sensor), generated reward (feedback value) and action data (output controller). For experimental platform and experiments, vision sensors are used for perception of the environment, different kinematic controllers create the required motion commands based on the platform application, deep learning approaches generate the required intelligence, and finally reinforcement learning techniques incrementally improve the generated intelligence until the mission is accomplished by the robot.</p></details> |  |

These factors can significantly hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection and image segmentation. As a result, improving the quality of low-light images is of paramount importance for practical applications in the computer vision domain.To effectively address these challenges, we present a novel low-light image enhancement model, termed Spatial Consistency Retinex Network (SCRNet), which leverages the Retinex-based structure and is guided by the principle of spatial consistency.Specifically, our proposed model incorporates three levels of consistency: channel level, semantic level, and texture level, inspired by the principle of spatial consistency.These levels of consistency enable our model to adaptively enhance image features, ensuring more accurate and visually pleasing results.Extensive experimental evaluations on various low-light image datasets demonstrate that our proposed SCRNet outshines existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the potential of SCRNet as an effective solution for enhancing low-light images.</p></details> |  |

However, it is non-trivial to translate human language instructions all the way to low-level leg joint actions. We propose NaVILA, a 2-level framework that unifies a Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) with locomotion skills. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions from VLA, NaVILA first generates mid-level actions with spatial information in the form of language, (e.g., "moving forward 75cm"), which serves as an input for a visual locomotion RL policy for execution. NaVILA substantially improves previous approaches on existing benchmarks. The same advantages are demonstrated in our newly developed benchmarks with IsaacLab, featuring more realistic scenes, low-level controls, and real-world robot experiments.

| **[Contrast: A Hybrid Architecture of Transformers and State Space Models for Low-Level Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13353v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become increasingly popular for image super-resolution (SR) tasks due to their strong global context modeling capabilities. However, their quadratic computational complexity necessitates the use of window-based attention mechanisms, which restricts the receptive field and limits effective context expansion. Recently, the Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative with linear computational complexity, allowing it to avoid window mechanisms and maintain a large receptive field. Nevertheless, Mamba faces challenges in handling long-context dependencies when high pixel-level precision is required, as in SR tasks. This is due to its hidden state mechanism, which can compress and store a substantial amount of context but only in an approximate manner, leading to inaccuracies that transformers do not suffer from. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Contrast}, a hybrid SR model that combines \textbf{Con}volutional, \textbf{Tra}nsformer, and \textbf{St}ate Space components, effectively blending the strengths of transformers and Mamba to address their individual limitations. By integrating transformer and state space mechanisms, \textbf{Contrast} compensates for the shortcomings of each approach, enhancing both global context modeling and pixel-level accuracy. We demonstrate that combining these two architectures allows us to mitigate the problems inherent in each, resulting in improved performance on image super-resolution tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Survey on Visual Mamba](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15956v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architectures, namely Mamba, have recently demonstrated significant promise in long-sequence modeling. Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Variational Translator for Bridging Image Restoration and High-Level Vision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08149v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research tries to extend image restoration capabilities from human perception to machine perception, thereby enhancing the performance of high-level vision tasks in degraded environments. These methods, primarily based on supervised learning, typically involve the retraining of restoration networks or high-level vision networks. However, collecting paired data in real-world scenarios and retraining large-scale models are challenge. To this end, we propose an unsupervised learning method called \textbf{Va}riational \textbf{T}ranslator (VaT), which does not require retraining existing restoration and high-level vision networks. Instead, it establishes a lightweight network that serves as an intermediate bridge between them. By variational inference, VaT approximates the joint distribution of restoration output and high-level vision input, dividing the optimization objective into preserving content and maximizing marginal likelihood associated with high-level vision tasks. By cleverly leveraging self-training paradigms, VaT achieves the above optimization objective without requiring labels. As a result, the translated images maintain a close resemblance to their original content while also demonstrating exceptional performance on high-level vision tasks. Extensive experiments in dehazing and low-light enhancement for detection and classification show the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts, even significantly surpassing supervised methods in some complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/VaT.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to its strong representation capabilities, researchers are looking at ways to apply transformer to computer vision tasks. In a variety of visual benchmarks, transformer-based models perform similar to or better than other types of networks such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Given its high performance and less need for vision-specific inductive bias, transformer is receiving more and more attention from the computer vision community. In this paper, we review these vision transformer models by categorizing them in different tasks and analyzing their advantages and disadvantages. The main categories we explore include the backbone network, high/mid-level vision, low-level vision, and video processing. We also include efficient transformer methods for pushing transformer into real device-based applications. Furthermore, we also take a brief look at the self-attention mechanism in computer vision, as it is the base component in transformer. Toward the end of this paper, we discuss the challenges and provide several further research directions for vision transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI 2022</p></details> |

Unfortunately, there is still an enormous performance gap between artificial vision systems and human intelligence in terms of higher-level vision problems, especially ones involving reasoning. Earlier attempts in equipping machines with high-level reasoning have hovered around Visual Question Answering (VQA), one typical task associating vision and language understanding. In this work, we propose a new dataset, built in the context of Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and aimed at lifting machine intelligence by associating vision with structural, relational, and analogical reasoning in a hierarchical representation. Unlike previous works in measuring abstract reasoning using RPM, we establish a semantic link between vision and reasoning by providing structure representation. This addition enables a new type of abstract reasoning by jointly operating on the structure representation. Machine reasoning ability using modern computer vision is evaluated in this newly proposed dataset. Additionally, we also provide human performance as a reference. Finally, we show consistent improvement across all models by incorporating a simple neural module that combines visual understanding and structure reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2019 paper.

However, almost all INRs methods are limited to low-level tasks, e.g., image/video compression, super-resolution, and image generation. The questions on how to explore INRs to high-level tasks and deep networks are still under-explored. Existing INRs methods suffer from two problems: 1) narrow theoretical definitions of INRs are inapplicable to high-level tasks; 2) lack of representation capabilities to deep networks. Motivated by the above facts, we reformulate the definitions of INRs from a novel perspective and propose an innovative Implicit Neural Representation Network (INRN), which is the first study of INRs to tackle both low-level and high-level tasks. Specifically, we present three key designs for basic blocks in INRN along with two different stacking ways and corresponding loss functions. Extensive experiments with analysis on both low-level tasks (image fitting) and high-level vision tasks (image classification, object detection, instance segmentation) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2023</p></details> |

While current synthetic data generators offer a promising alternative, particularly for embodied AI tasks, they often fall short for computer vision tasks due to low asset and rendering quality, limited diversity, and unrealistic physical properties. We introduce the BEHAVIOR Vision Suite (BVS), a set of tools and assets to generate fully customized synthetic data for systematic evaluation of computer vision models, based on the newly developed embodied AI benchmark, BEHAVIOR-1K. BVS supports a large number of adjustable parameters at the scene level (e.g., lighting, object placement), the object level (e.g., joint configuration, attributes such as "filled" and "folded"), and the camera level (e.g., field of view, focal length). Researchers can arbitrarily vary these parameters during data generation to perform controlled experiments. We showcase three example application scenarios: systematically evaluating the robustness of models across different continuous axes of domain shift, evaluating scene understanding models on the same set of images, and training and evaluating simulation-to-real transfer for a novel vision task: unary and binary state prediction.

| **[Building Efficient Query Engines in a High-Level Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05566v1)** | 2016-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstraction without regret refers to the vision of using high-level programming languages for systems development without experiencing a negative impact on performance. A database system designed according to this vision offers both increased productivity and high performance, instead of sacrificing the former for the latter as is the case with existing, monolithic implementations that are hard to maintain and extend. In this article, we realize this vision in the domain of analytical query processing. We present LegoBase, a query engine written in the high-level language Scala. The key technique to regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: LegoBase performs source-to-source compilation and optimizes the entire query engine by converting the high-level Scala code to specialized, low-level C code. We show how generative programming allows to easily implement a wide spectrum of optimizations, such as introducing data partitioning or switching from a row to a column data layout, which are difficult to achieve with existing low-level query compilers that handle only queries. We demonstrate that sufficiently powerful abstractions are essential for dealing with the complexity of the optimization effort, shielding developers from compiler internals and decoupling individual optimizations from each other. We evaluate our approach with the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) With all optimizations enabled, LegoBase significantly outperforms a commercial database and an existing query compiler. (b) Programmers need to provide just a few hundred lines of high-level code for implementing the optimizations, instead of complicated low-level code that is required by existing query compilation approaches. (c) The compilation overhead is low compared to the overall execution time, thus making our approach usable in practice for compiling query engines.</p></details> |  |

Beyond visual text detection and recognition, the field of visual text processing has experienced a surge in research, driven by the advent of fundamental generative models. However, challenges persist due to the unique properties and features that distinguish text from general objects. Effectively leveraging these unique textual characteristics is crucial in visual text processing, as observed in our study. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in this field. Initially, we introduce a hierarchical taxonomy encompassing areas ranging from text image enhancement and restoration to text image manipulation, followed by different learning paradigms. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth discussion of how specific textual features such as structure, stroke, semantics, style, and spatial context are seamlessly integrated into various tasks. Furthermore, we explore available public datasets and benchmark the reviewed methods on several widely-used datasets. Finally, we identify principal challenges and potential avenues for future research. Our aim is to establish this survey as a fundamental resource, fostering continued exploration and innovation in the dynamic area of visual text processing.</p></details> |  |

Although yielding impressive results, the impact of the language prior, particularly in terms of generalization and robustness, remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by quantifying the impact of this prior and introduce methods to benchmark its effectiveness across various settings. We generate "low-level" sentences that convey object-centric, three-dimensional spatial relationships, incorporate them as additional language priors and evaluate their downstream impact on depth estimation. Our key finding is that current language-guided depth estimators perform optimally only with scene-level descriptions and counter-intuitively fare worse with low level descriptions. Despite leveraging additional data, these methods are not robust to directed adversarial attacks and decline in performance with an increase in distribution shift. Finally, to provide a foundation for future research, we identify points of failures and offer insights to better understand these shortcomings. With an increasing number of methods using language for depth estimation, our findings highlight the opportunities and pitfalls that require careful consideration for effective deployment in real-world settings</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024.

Retinex theory addresses this by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and illumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under changing light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have four key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently; (ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot perfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color constancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the scene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and illumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the Reflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face detection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11 percent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and higher reflectance stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixels to Voxels: Modeling Visual Representation in the Human Brain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5104v1)** | 2014-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The human brain is adept at solving difficult high-level visual processing problems such as image interpretation and object recognition in natural scenes. Over the past few years neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in understanding how the human brain represents categories of objects and actions in natural scenes. However, all current models of high-level human vision operate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been assigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for high-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new class of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from computer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on Fisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain activity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need for any semantic tags or hand annotation of images. This is the first time that such a mapping has been obtained. The fit models provide a new platform for exploring the functional principles of human vision, and they show that modern methods of computer vision and machine learning provide important tools for characterizing brain function.</p></details> |  |

VLMs, typically pre-trained on vision-language understanding tasks, provide rich semantic knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, prior research has shown that VLMs often focus on high-level semantic content and neglect low-level features, limiting their ability to capture detailed spatial information and understand physical dynamics. These aspects, which are crucial for embodied control tasks, remain underexplored in existing pre-training paradigms. In this paper, we investigate the training paradigm for VLAs, and introduce \textbf{UP-VLA}, a \textbf{U}nified VLA model training with both multi-modal \textbf{U}nderstanding and future \textbf{P}rediction objectives, enhancing both high-level semantic comprehension and low-level spatial understanding. Experimental results show that UP-VLA achieves a 33% improvement on the Calvin ABC-D benchmark compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, UP-VLA demonstrates improved success rates in real-world manipulation tasks, particularly those requiring precise spatial information.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |

We take a modular approach where the high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in complex environments designed for humans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Data Augmentation for Image Super-resolution: A Comprehensive Analysis and a New Strategy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00448v2)** | 2020-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is an effective way to improve the performance of deep networks. Unfortunately, current methods are mostly developed for high-level vision tasks (e.g., classification) and few are studied for low-level vision tasks (e.g., image restoration). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing augmentation methods applied to the super-resolution task. We find that the methods discarding or manipulating the pixels or features too much hamper the image restoration, where the spatial relationship is very important. Based on our analyses, we propose CutBlur that cuts a low-resolution patch and pastes it to the corresponding high-resolution image region and vice versa. The key intuition of CutBlur is to enable a model to learn not only "how" but also "where" to super-resolve an image. By doing so, the model can understand "how much", instead of blindly learning to apply super-resolution to every given pixel. Our method consistently and significantly improves the performance across various scenarios, especially when the model size is big and the data is collected under real-world environments. We also show that our method improves other low-level vision tasks, such as denoising and compression artifact removal.</p></details> |  |

However, when it comes to low-level vision such as image restoration their performance deteriorates dramatically due to corrupted inputs. In this paper, we present a degradation-aware vision-language model (DA-CLIP) to better transfer pretrained vision-language models to low-level vision tasks as a multi-task framework for image restoration. More specifically, DA-CLIP trains an additional controller that adapts the fixed CLIP image encoder to predict high-quality feature embeddings. By integrating the embedding into an image restoration network via cross-attention, we are able to pilot the model to learn a high-fidelity image reconstruction. The controller itself will also output a degradation feature that matches the real corruptions of the input, yielding a natural classifier for different degradation types. In addition, we construct a mixed degradation dataset with synthetic captions for DA-CLIP training. Our approach advances state-of-the-art performance on both \emph{degradation-specific} and \emph{unified} image restoration tasks, showing a promising direction of prompting image restoration with large-scale pretrained vision-language models.

However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal, various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements over existing LUT methods.</p></details> |  |

We analyze the reason behind this phenomenon, and propose a novel irregular patch embedding module and adaptive patch fusion module to improve the performance. We conjecture that the vision transformer blocks (which consist of multi-head attention and feed-forward network) are more suitable to handle high-level information than low-level features. The irregular patch embedding module extracts patches that contain rich high-level information with different receptive fields. The transformer blocks can obtain the most useful information from these irregular patches. Then the processed patches pass the adaptive patch merging module to get the final features for the classifier. With our proposed improvements, the traditional uniform vision transformer structure can achieve state-of-the-art results in mobile level. We improve the DeiT baseline by more than 9\% under the mobile-level settings and surpass other transformer architectures like Swin and CoaT by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages; 5 figures; preprint</p></details> |

We suspect that the power of their self-attention mechanism is limited in shallower and thinner networks. We propose Lite Vision Transformer (LVT), a novel light-weight transformer network with two enhanced self-attention mechanisms to improve the model performances for mobile deployment. For the low-level features, we introduce Convolutional Self-Attention (CSA). Unlike previous approaches of merging convolution and self-attention, CSA introduces local self-attention into the convolution within a kernel of size 3x3 to enrich low-level features in the first stage of LVT. For the high-level features, we propose Recursive Atrous Self-Attention (RASA), which utilizes the multi-scale context when calculating the similarity map and a recursive mechanism to increase the representation capability with marginal extra parameter cost.

However, the exploration of MLLM potential in visual quality assessment, a vital aspect of low-level vision, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce Q-Boost, a novel strategy designed to enhance low-level MLLMs in image quality assessment (IQA) and video quality assessment (VQA) tasks, which is structured around two pivotal components: 1) Triadic-Tone Integration: Ordinary prompt design simply oscillates between the binary extremes of $positive$ and $negative$. Q-Boost innovates by incorporating a `middle ground' approach through $neutral$ prompts, allowing for a more balanced and detailed assessment. 2) Multi-Prompt Ensemble: Multiple quality-centric prompts are used to mitigate bias and acquire more accurate evaluation. The experimental results show that the low-level MLLMs exhibit outstanding zeros-shot performance on the IQA/VQA tasks equipped with the Q-Boost strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Feature Learning for low-level Local Image Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2840v4)** | 2013-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised feature learning has shown impressive results for a wide range of input modalities, in particular for object classification tasks in computer vision. Using a large amount of unlabeled data, unsupervised feature learning methods are utilized to construct high-level representations that are discriminative enough for subsequently trained supervised classification algorithms. However, it has never been \emph{quantitatively} investigated yet how well unsupervised learning methods can find \emph{low-level representations} for image patches without any additional supervision. In this paper we examine the performance of pure unsupervised methods on a low-level correspondence task, a problem that is central to many Computer Vision applications. We find that a special type of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) performs comparably to hand-crafted descriptors. Additionally, a simple binarization scheme produces compact representations that perform better than several state-of-the-art descriptors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Low-Level Visual Hallucinations Requires Self-Awareness: Database, Model and Training Strategy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20673v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework. However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems. While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROSA: Harnessing Robot States for Vision-Language and Action Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13679v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently made significant advance in multi-task, end-to-end robotic control, due to the strong generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). A fundamental challenge in developing such models is effectively aligning the vision-language space with the robotic action space. Existing approaches typically rely on directly fine-tuning VLMs using expert demonstrations. However, this strategy suffers from a spatio-temporal gap, resulting in considerable data inefficiency and heavy reliance on human labor. Spatially, VLMs operate within a high-level semantic space, whereas robotic actions are grounded in low-level 3D physical space; temporally, VLMs primarily interpret the present, while VLA models anticipate future actions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel training paradigm, ROSA, which leverages robot state estimation to improve alignment between vision-language and action spaces. By integrating robot state estimation data obtained via an automated process, ROSA enables the VLA model to gain enhanced spatial understanding and self-awareness, thereby boosting performance and generalization. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of ROSA, particularly in low-data regimes.</p></details> |  |

Traditional Rubik's Cube robots, relying on complex vision systems and fixed algorithms, often struggle to adapt to complex and dynamic scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CubeRobot, a novel vision-language model (VLM) tailored for solving 3x3 Rubik's Cubes, empowering embodied agents with multimodal understanding and execution capabilities. We used the CubeCoT image dataset, which contains multiple-level tasks (43 subtasks in total) that humans are unable to handle, encompassing various cube states. We incorporate a dual-loop VisionCoT architecture and Memory Stream, a paradigm for extracting task-related features from VLM-generated planning queries, thus enabling CubeRobot to independent planning, decision-making, reflection and separate management of high- and low-level Rubik's Cube tasks. Furthermore, in low-level Rubik's Cube restoration tasks, CubeRobot achieved a high accuracy rate of 100%, similar to 100% in medium-level tasks, and achieved an accuracy rate of 80% in high-level tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present VITRON, a universal pixel-level vision LLM designed for comprehensive understanding, generating, segmenting, and editing of both static images and dynamic videos. Building on top of an LLM backbone, VITRON incorporates encoders for images, videos, and pixel-level regional visuals within its frontend modules, while employing state-of-the-art visual specialists as its backend, via which VITRON supports a spectrum of vision end tasks, spanning visual comprehension to visual generation, from low level to high level. To ensure an effective and precise message passing from LLM to backend modules for function invocation, we propose a novel hybrid method by simultaneously integrating discrete textual instructions and continuous signal embeddings. Further, we design various pixel-level spatiotemporal vision-language alignment learning for VITRON to reach the best fine-grained visual capability. Finally, a cross-task synergy module is advised to learn to maximize the task-invariant fine-grained visual features, enhancing the synergy between different visual tasks. Demonstrated over 12 visual tasks and evaluated across 22 datasets, VITRON showcases its extensive capabilities in the four main vision task clusters. Overall, this work illuminates the great potential of developing a more unified multimodal generalist.

Computer-vision-based deep learning models applied to spectrograms have proven useful in the field of signal classification and detection; however, these methods aren't designed to handle the low signal-to-noise ratios inherent within non-vision signal processing tasks.

We note that edge detection is one of the most fundamental process within the low level vision and provides the basis for the higher level visual intelligence in primates. The recognition of the patterns within the images relate closely to the spatiotemporal processes of edge formations, and its implementation needs a crossdisciplanry approach in neuroscience, computing and pattern recognition. In this review, the edge detectors are grouped in as edge features, gradients and sketch models, and some example applications are provided for reference. We note a significant increase in the amount of published research in the last decade that utilizes edge features in a wide range of problems in computer vision and image understanding having a direct implication to pattern recognition with images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Int. ...</summary><p>Int.

Yet, with the shift to sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and terahertz (THz) radio communications, there is an opportunity to explore computer vision technologies together with radio communications, considering the dependency of both technologies on Line of Sight. The combination of radio sensing and computer vision can address challenges such as obstructions and poor lighting. Also, machine learning algorithms, capable of processing multimodal data, play a crucial role in deriving insights from raw and low-level sensing data, offering a new level of abstraction that can enhance various applications and use cases such as beamforming and terminal handovers. This paper introduces CONVERGE, a pioneering vision-radio paradigm that bridges this gap by leveraging Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) to facilitate a dual "View-to-Communicate, Communicate-to-View" approach. CONVERGE offers tools that merge wireless communications and computer vision, establishing a novel Research Infrastructure (RI) that will be open to the scientific community and capable of providing open datasets. This new infrastructure will support future research in 6G and beyond concerning multiple verticals, such as telecommunications, automotive, manufacturing, media, and health.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11835v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Its special nature make them a fascinating tool to test and validate any new vision model proposed. In general, current vision models are based on the concatenation of linear convolutions and non-linear operations. In this paper we get inspiration from the similarity of this structure with the operations present in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This motivated us to study if CNNs trained for low-level visual tasks are deceived by visual illusions. In particular, we show that CNNs trained for image denoising, image deblurring, and computational color constancy are able to replicate the human response to visual illusions, and that the extent of this replication varies with respect to variation in architecture and spatial pattern size. We believe that this CNNs behaviour appears as a by-product of the training for the low level vision tasks of denoising, color constancy or deblurring. Our work opens a new bridge between human perception and CNNs: in order to obtain CNNs that better replicate human behaviour, we may need to start aiming for them to better replicate visual illusions.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by OpenCV, Kornia is composed of a set of modules containing operators that can be inserted inside neural networks to train models to perform image transformations, camera calibration, epipolar geometry, and low level image processing techniques, such as filtering and edge detection that operate directly on high dimensional tensor representations.

For a long time, hand-crafted designs, like the seminal SIFT algorithm, were unsurpassed in accuracy and efficiency. Recently, learned feature detectors emerged that implement detection and description using neural networks. Training these networks usually resorts to optimizing low-level matching scores, often pre-defining sets of image patches which should or should not match, or which should or should not contain key points. Unfortunately, increased accuracy for these low-level matching scores does not necessarily translate to better performance in high-level vision tasks. We propose a new training methodology which embeds the feature detector in a complete vision pipeline, and where the learnable parameters are trained in an end-to-end fashion. We overcome the discrete nature of key point selection and descriptor matching using principles from reinforcement learning. As an example, we address the task of relative pose estimation between a pair of images. We demonstrate that the accuracy of a state-of-the-art learning-based feature detector can be increased when trained for the task it is supposed to solve at test time. Our training methodology poses little restrictions on the task to learn, and works for any architecture which predicts key point heat maps, and descriptors for key point locations.</p></details> | CVPR 2020 (oral) |
| **[DualToken: Towards Unifying Visual Understanding and Generation with Dual Visual Vocabularies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14324v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The differing representation spaces required for visual understanding and generation pose a challenge in unifying them within the autoregressive paradigm of large language models. A vision tokenizer trained for reconstruction excels at capturing low-level perceptual details, making it well-suited for visual generation but lacking high-level semantic representations for understanding tasks. Conversely, a vision encoder trained via contrastive learning aligns well with language but struggles to decode back into the pixel space for generation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose DualToken, a method that unifies representations for both understanding and generation within a single tokenizer. However, directly integrating reconstruction and semantic objectives in a single tokenizer creates conflicts, leading to degraded performance in both reconstruction quality and semantic performance. Instead of forcing a single codebook to handle both semantic and perceptual information, DualToken disentangles them by introducing separate codebooks for high and low-level features, effectively transforming their inherent conflict into a synergistic relationship. As a result, DualToken achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and semantic tasks while demonstrating remarkable effectiveness in downstream MLLM understanding and generation tasks. Notably, we also show that DualToken, as a unified tokenizer, surpasses the naive combination of two distinct types vision encoders, providing superior performance within a unified MLLM.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have made significant progress in high-level cognition with Foundation Models (FMs) and low-level skill development for humanoid robots. However, directly combining these components often results in poor robustness and efficiency due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and the varied latency of different modules. We introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. The FM handles high-level cognitive tasks such as instruction understanding, task planning, and reasoning, while the skill library provides stable locomotion and dexterous manipulation for low-level control. To bridge the gap between these levels, we propose a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). The Connector enhances the FM's embodied capabilities by translating language-based plans into actionable skill commands and dynamically coordinating locomotion and manipulation to improve task success. With all components, except the FM, deployable on low-cost onboard computation devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and active vision. Extensive experiments in large indoor environments demonstrate Being-0's effectiveness in solving complex, long-horizon tasks that require challenging navigation and manipulation subtasks.

Key challenges of this task are understanding the meaning of complex and ambiguous language expressions and determining the relevant regions in the image with multiple objects by referring to the expression. Recent models have focused on the early fusion with the language features at the intermediate stage of the vision encoder, but these approaches have a limitation that the language features cannot refer to the visual information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel architecture, Cross-aware early fusion with stage-divided Vision and Language Transformer encoders (CrossVLT), which allows both language and vision encoders to perform the early fusion for improving the ability of the cross-modal context modeling. Unlike previous methods, our method enables the vision and language features to refer to each other's information at each stage to mutually enhance the robustness of both encoders. Furthermore, unlike the conventional scheme that relies solely on the high-level features for the cross-modal alignment, we introduce a feature-based alignment scheme that enables the low-level to high-level features of the vision and language encoders to engage in the cross-modal alignment. By aligning the intermediate cross-modal features in all encoder stages, this scheme leads to effective cross-modal fusion. In this way, the proposed approach is simple but effective for referring image segmentation, and it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

By developing autonomous grasping reflexes that rely on high-bandwidth force, contact, and proximity data, the overall system speed and robustness can be increased while reducing reliance on vision data. We are developing a new system built around a low-inertia, high-speed arm with nimble fingers that combines a high-level trajectory planner operating at less than 1 Hz with low-level autonomous reflex controllers running upwards of 300 Hz. We characterize the reflex system by comparing the volume of the set of successful grasps for a naive baseline controller and variations of our reflexive grasping controller, finding that our controller expands the set of successful grasps by 55% relative to the baseline. We also deploy our reflexive grasping controller with a simple vision-based planner in an autonomous clutter clearing task, achieving a grasp success rate above 90% while clearing over 100 items.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 page of references, supplementary video at https://youtu.be/f8Coo02Jvdg.

This study investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations, improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.</p></details> |  |

It is worth noting that the proposed dual-arm flattening approach is unique among the state-of-the-art robot autonomous system, which is the major contribution of this paper. The experimental results show that the proposed dual-arm flattening using stereo vision system remarkably outperforms the single-arm flattening and widely-cited Kinect-based sensing system for dexterous manipulation tasks.

However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision, we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

Event cameras offer attractive properties compared to traditional cameras: high temporal resolution (in the order of microseconds), very high dynamic range (140 dB vs. 60 dB), low power consumption, and high pixel bandwidth (on the order of kHz) resulting in reduced motion blur. Hence, event cameras have a large potential for robotics and computer vision in challenging scenarios for traditional cameras, such as low-latency, high speed, and high dynamic range. However, novel methods are required to process the unconventional output of these sensors in order to unlock their potential. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of event-based vision, with a focus on the applications and the algorithms developed to unlock the outstanding properties of event cameras. We present event cameras from their working principle, the actual sensors that are available and the tasks that they have been used for, from low-level vision (feature detection and tracking, optic flow, etc.) to high-level vision (reconstruction, segmentation, recognition). We also discuss the techniques developed to process events, including learning-based techniques, as well as specialized processors for these novel sensors, such as spiking neural networks. Additionally, we highlight the challenges that remain to be tackled and the opportunities that lie ahead in the search for a more efficient, bio-inspired way for machines to perceive and interact with the world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAMSTER: Hierarchical Action Models For Open-World Robot Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05485v4)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models have shown strong open-world generalization to complex problems in vision and language, but similar levels of generalization have yet to be achieved in robotics. One fundamental challenge is the lack of robotic data, which are typically obtained through expensive on-robot operation. A promising remedy is to leverage cheaper, off-domain data such as action-free videos, hand-drawn sketches or simulation data. In this work, we posit that hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) models can be more effective in utilizing off-domain data than standard monolithic VLA models that directly finetune vision-language models (VLMs) to predict actions. In particular, we study a class of hierarchical VLA models, where the high-level VLM is finetuned to produce a coarse 2D path indicating the desired robot end-effector trajectory given an RGB image and a task description. The intermediate 2D path prediction is then served as guidance to the low-level, 3D-aware control policy capable of precise manipulation. Doing so alleviates the high-level VLM from fine-grained action prediction, while reducing the low-level policy's burden on complex task-level reasoning. We show that, with the hierarchical design, the high-level VLM can transfer across significant domain gaps between the off-domain finetuning data and real-robot testing scenarios, including differences on embodiments, dynamics, visual appearances and task semantics, etc. In the real-robot experiments, we observe an average of 20% improvement in success rate across seven different axes of generalization over OpenVLA, representing a 50% relative gain.

While most existing research treats MLLMs as unified systems optimized through end-to-end training, the impact of vision encoder's prior knowledge is seldom investigated. In this work, we introduce a novel metric, $Rank_e$, to quantify the effect of prior knowledge of the vision encoder on MLLM performance. Our analysis reveals a positive correlation between prior knowledge and MLLM performance. Moreover, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning using solely end-to-end visual question answering (VQA) data is insufficient, particularly for entities with low inherent visual prior knowledge. To address this issue, we propose VisPRE (Vision Prior Remediation), a two-stage training framework that explicitly incorporates prior knowledge at the vision encoder level. Experimental results demonstrate that augmenting vision encoder's prior knowledge substantially boosts the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs, offering a novel and effective strategy for improving performance, especially in scenarios involving uncommon visual entities.</p></details> |  |

However, the standard practice of relying on real-world images primarily from the Internet comes with image quality, scalability, and privacy issues, especially in commercial contexts. To address this, we have developed a procedural synthetic data generation pipeline and dataset tailored to low-level vision tasks. Our Unreal engine-based synthetic data pipeline populates large scenes algorithmically with a combination of random 3D objects, materials, and geometric transformations. Then, we calibrate the camera noise profiles to synthesize the noisy images. From this pipeline, we generated a fully synthetic image denoising dataset (FSID) which consists of 175,000 noisy/clean image pairs. We then trained and validated a CNN-based denoising model, and demonstrated that the model trained on this synthetic data alone can achieve competitive denoising results when evaluated on real-world noisy images captured with smartphone cameras.</p></details> |  |

As a classic regression problem, SR exhibits a different behaviour as high-level tasks and is sensitive to the dropout operation. However, in this paper, we show that appropriate usage of dropout benefits SR networks and improves the generalization ability. Specifically, dropout is better embedded at the end of the network and is significantly helpful for the multi-degradation settings. This discovery breaks our common sense and inspires us to explore its working mechanism. We further use two analysis tools -- one is from recent network interpretation works, and the other is specially designed for this task. The analysis results provide side proofs to our experimental findings and show us a new perspective to understand SR networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2022 paper + supplementary file</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-based Camera Exposure Control for Outdoor Mobile Platforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.07338v3)** | 2018-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel method to automatically adjust camera exposure for image processing and computer vision applications on mobile robot platforms. Because most image processing algorithms rely heavily on low-level image features that are based mainly on local gradient information, we consider that gradient quantity can determine the proper exposure level, allowing a camera to capture the important image features in a manner robust to illumination conditions. We then extend this concept to a multi-camera system and present a new control algorithm to achieve both brightness consistency between adjacent cameras and a proper exposure level for each camera. We implement our prototype system with off-the-shelf machine-vision cameras and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on practical applications, including pedestrian detection, visual odometry, surround-view imaging, panoramic imaging and stereo matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of IROS 2014</p></details> |
| **[FedVSR: Towards Model-Agnostic Federated Learning in Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13745v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video super-resolution aims to enhance low-resolution videos by leveraging both spatial and temporal information. While deep learning has led to impressive progress, it typically requires centralized data, which raises privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly solution, but general FL frameworks often struggle with low-level vision tasks, resulting in blurry, low-quality outputs. To address this, we introduce FedVSR, the first FL framework specifically designed for VSR. It is model-agnostic and stateless, and introduces a lightweight loss function based on the DWT to better preserve high-frequency details during local training. Additionally, a loss-aware aggregation strategy combines both DWT-based and task-specific losses to guide global updates effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple VSR models and datasets demonstrate that FedVSR consistently outperforms existing FL methods, achieving up to 0.82 dB higher PSNR, 0.0327 higher SSIM, and 0.0251 lower LPIPS. These results underscore FedVSR's ability to bridge the gap between privacy and performance, setting a new benchmark for federated learning in low-level vision tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/alimd94/FedVSR</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version includes an updated abstract and introduction for improved clarity and context. We also added the LPIPS metric to our evaluation results to provide a more comprehensive assessment of perceptual quality</p></details> |
