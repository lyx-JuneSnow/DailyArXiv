| **[Mogao: An Omni Foundation Model for Interleaved Multi-Modal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05472v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in unified models for image understanding and generation has been impressive, yet most approaches remain limited to single-modal generation conditioned on multiple modalities. In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[MDE-Edit: Masked Dual-Editing for Multi-Object Image Editing via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05101v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1) Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment, leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality, offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[GlyphMastero: A Glyph Encoder for High-Fidelity Scene Text Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04915v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene text editing, a subfield of image editing, requires modifying texts in images while preserving style consistency and visual coherence with the surrounding environment. While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level. Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation process. Our method achieves an 18.02\% improvement in sentence accuracy over the state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while simultaneously reducing the text-region Fr\'echet inception distance by 53.28\%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Lay-Your-Scene: Natural Scene Layout Generation with Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04718v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Lay-Your-Scene (shorthand LayouSyn), a novel text-to-layout generation pipeline for natural scenes. Prior scene layout generation methods are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn in image editing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ming-Lite-Uni: Advancements in Unified Architecture for Natural Multimodal Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02471v2)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Ming-Lite-Uni, an open-source multimodal framework featuring a newly designed unified visual generator and a native multimodal autoregressive model tailored for unifying vision and language. Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of Ming-Lite-Uni and illustrate the impressive fluid nature of its interactive process. All code and model weights are open-sourced to foster further exploration within the community. Notably, this work aligns with concurrent multimodal AI milestones - such as ChatGPT-4o with native image generation updated in March 25, 2025 - underscoring the broader significance of unified models like Ming-Lite-Uni on the path toward AGI. Ming-Lite-Uni is in alpha stage and will soon be further refined.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/inclusionAI/Ming/tree/main/Ming-unify</p></details> |
| **[Multi-turn Consistent Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04320v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications, such as interactive photo retouching, artistic content creation, and product design, require flexible and iterative image editing. However, existing image editing methods primarily focus on achieving the desired modifications in a single step, which often struggles with ambiguous user intent, complex transformations, or the need for progressive refinements. As a result, these methods frequently produce inconsistent outcomes or fail to meet user expectations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-turn image editing framework that enables users to iteratively refine their edits, progressively achieving more satisfactory results. Our approach leverages flow matching for accurate image inversion and a dual-objective Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) for stable sampling, effectively mitigating error accumulation. Additionally, by analyzing the layer-wise roles of transformers, we introduce a adaptive attention highlighting method that enhances editability while preserving multi-turn coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves edit success rates and visual fidelity compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Step1X-Edit: A Practical Framework for General Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17761v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step1X-Edit</p></details> |
| **[HumanEdit: A High-Quality Human-Rewarded Dataset for Instruction-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04280v2)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HumanEdit, a high-quality, human-rewarded dataset specifically designed for instruction-guided image editing, enabling precise and diverse image manipulations through open-form language instructions. Previous large-scale editing datasets often incorporate minimal human feedback, leading to challenges in aligning datasets with human preferences. HumanEdit bridges this gap by employing human annotators to construct data pairs and administrators to provide feedback. With meticulously curation, HumanEdit comprises 5,751 images and requires more than 2,500 hours of human effort across four stages, ensuring both accuracy and reliability for a wide range of image editing tasks. The dataset includes six distinct types of editing instructions: Action, Add, Counting, Relation, Remove, and Replace, encompassing a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. All images in the dataset are accompanied by masks, and for a subset of the data, we ensure that the instructions are sufficiently detailed to support mask-free editing. Furthermore, HumanEdit offers comprehensive diversity and high-resolution $1024 \times 1024$ content sourced from various domains, setting a new versatile benchmark for instructional image editing datasets. With the aim of advancing future research and establishing evaluation benchmarks in the field of image editing, we release HumanEdit at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BryanW/HumanEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation (AI4CC) Workshop.

| **[BrushEdit: All-In-One Image Inpainting and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10316v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image editing has advanced significantly with the development of diffusion models using both inversion-based and instruction-based methods. However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>WebPa...</summary><p>WebPage available at https://liyaowei-stu.github.io/project/BrushEdit/</p></details> |
| **[SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02370v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, Data and Models are available at: https://github.com/bytedance/SuperEdit</p></details> |

| **[Multiple Information Prompt Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00330v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification is a subject closer to the real world, which focuses on solving the problem of person re-identification after pedestrians change clothes. The primary challenge in this field is to overcome the complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to identify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient data collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this problem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice. Current methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the original image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely limited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional model. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel multiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person ReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance of multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS) module is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB image features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The Bio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning intensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP) module is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the impact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID, Celeb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%, 66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively. When compared to AIM (CVPR23), ACID (TIP23), and SCNet (MM23), MIPL achieves rank-1 improvements of 11.3%, 13.8%, and 7.9%, respectively, on the PRCC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Clothes Changing Person ReID: Conflicts, Synthesis, and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12611v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same person wearing different outfits. Mainstream researches focus on designing advanced model structures and strategies to capture identity information independent of clothing. However, the same-clothes discrimination as the standard ReID learning objective in CC-ReID is persistently ignored in previous researches. In this study, we dive into the relationship between standard and clothes-changing~(CC) learning objectives, and bring the inner conflicts between these two objectives to the fore. We try to magnify the proportion of CC training pairs by supplementing high-fidelity clothes-varying synthesis, produced by our proposed Clothes-Changing Diffusion model. By incorporating the synthetic images into CC-ReID model training, we observe a significant improvement under CC protocol. However, such improvement sacrifices the performance under the standard protocol, caused by the inner conflict between standard and CC. For conflict mitigation, we decouple these objectives and re-formulate CC-ReID learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. By effectively regularizing the gradient curvature across multiple objectives and introducing preference restrictions, our MOO solution surpasses the single-task training paradigm. Our framework is model-agnostic, and demonstrates superior performance under both CC and standard ReID protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEFF: Improving Any Clothes-Changing Person ReID Model using Gallery Enrichment with Face Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13807v2)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) problem, given a query sample of a person, the goal is to determine the correct identity based on a labeled gallery in which the person appears in different clothes. Several models tackle this challenge by extracting clothes-independent features. However, the performance of these models is still lower for the clothes-changing setting compared to the same-clothes setting in which the person appears with the same clothes in the labeled gallery. As clothing-related features are often dominant features in the data, we propose a new process we call Gallery Enrichment, to utilize these features. In this process, we enrich the original gallery by adding to it query samples based on their face features, using an unsupervised algorithm. Additionally, we show that combining ReID and face feature extraction modules alongside an enriched gallery results in a more accurate ReID model, even for query samples with new outfits that do not include faces. Moreover, we claim that existing CC-ReID benchmarks do not fully represent real-world scenarios, and propose a new video CC-ReID dataset called 42Street, based on a theater play that includes crowded scenes and numerous clothes changes. When applied to multiple ReID models, our method (GEFF) achieves an average improvement of 33.5% and 6.7% in the Top-1 clothes-changing metric on the PRCC and LTCC benchmarks. Combined with the latest ReID models, our method achieves new SOTA results on the PRCC, LTCC, CCVID, LaST and VC-Clothes benchmarks and the proposed 42Street dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08387v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2108.04527</p></details> |
| **[Identity-Guided Collaborative Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04400v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information), cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised clothing change adaptive person ReID](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03702v2)** | 2021-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothing changes and lack of data labels are both crucial challenges in person ReID. For the former challenge, people may occur multiple times at different locations wearing different clothing. However, most of the current person ReID research works focus on the benchmarks in which a person's clothing is kept the same all the time. For the last challenge, some researchers try to make model learn information from a labeled dataset as a source to an unlabeled dataset. Whereas purely unsupervised training is less used. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems at the same time. We design a novel unsupervised model, Sync-Person-Cloud ReID, to solve the unsupervised clothing change person ReID problem. We developer a purely unsupervised clothing change person ReID pipeline with person sync augmentation operation and same person feature restriction. The person sync augmentation is to supply additional same person resources. These same person's resources can be used as part supervised input by same person feature restriction. The extensive experiments on clothing change ReID datasets show the out-performance of our methods.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Multigranular Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04527v1)** | 2021-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail. To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task, but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme (MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic information that is used to align the human attributes.</p></details> |  |
