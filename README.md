| **[Causality and "In-the-Wild" Video-Based Person Re-ID: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20540v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world deployments despite impressive benchmark performance. Most existing models rely on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures. In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness, interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption. Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Person Re-Identification: A Systematic Survey of Challenges and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06057v2)** | 2021-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been a significant research topic in the past decade due to its real-world applications and research significance. While supervised person Re-ID methods achieve superior performance over unsupervised counterparts, they can not scale to large unlabelled datasets and new domains due to the prohibitive labelling cost. Therefore, unsupervised person Re-ID has drawn increasing attention for its potential to address the scalability issue in person Re-ID. Unsupervised person Re-ID is challenging primarily due to lacking identity labels to supervise person feature learning. The corresponding solutions are diverse and complex, with various merits and limitations. Therefore, comprehensive surveys on this topic are essential to summarise challenges and solutions to foster future research. Existing person Re-ID surveys have focused on supervised methods from classifications and applications but lack detailed discussion on how the person Re-ID solutions address the underlying challenges. This survey review recent works on unsupervised person Re-ID from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of highly influential methods considering the four significant challenges in unsupervised person Re-ID: 1) lacking ground-truth identity labels to supervise person feature learning; 2) learning discriminative person features with pseudo-supervision; 3) learning cross-camera invariant person feature, and 4) the domain shift between datasets. We summarise and analyse evaluation results and provide insights on the effectiveness of the solutions. Finally, we discuss open issues and suggest some promising future research directions.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Weakly Supervised Person Re-ID: Differentiable Graphical Learning and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03845v3)** | 2020-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) benefits greatly from the accurate annotations of existing datasets (e.g., CUHK03 [1] and Market-1501 [2]), which are quite expensive because each image in these datasets has to be assigned with a proper label. In this work, we ease the annotation of Re-ID by replacing the accurate annotation with inaccurate annotation, i.e., we group the images into bags in terms of time and assign a bag-level label for each bag. This greatly reduces the annotation effort and leads to the creation of a large-scale Re-ID benchmark called SYSU-30$k$. The new benchmark contains $30k$ individuals, which is about $20$ times larger than CUHK03 ($1.3k$ individuals) and Market-1501 ($1.5k$ individuals), and $30$ times larger than ImageNet ($1k$ categories). It sums up to 29,606,918 images. Learning a Re-ID model with bag-level annotation is called the weakly supervised Re-ID problem. To solve this problem, we introduce a differentiable graphical model to capture the dependencies from all images in a bag and generate a reliable pseudo label for each person image. The pseudo label is further used to supervise the learning of the Re-ID model. When compared with the fully supervised Re-ID models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SYSU-30$k$ and other datasets. The code, dataset, and pretrained model will be available at \url{https://github.com/wanggrun/SYSU-30k}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2020</p></details> |
| **[CANU-ReID: A Conditional Adversarial Network for Unsupervised person Re-IDentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01308v2)** | 2020-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised person re-ID is the task of identifying people on a target data set for which the ID labels are unavailable during training. In this paper, we propose to unify two trends in unsupervised person re-ID: clustering & fine-tuning and adversarial learning. On one side, clustering groups training images into pseudo-ID labels, and uses them to fine-tune the feature extractor. On the other side, adversarial learning is used, inspired by domain adaptation, to match distributions from different domains. Since target data is distributed across different camera viewpoints, we propose to model each camera as an independent domain, and aim to learn domain-independent features. Straightforward adversarial learning yields negative transfer, we thus introduce a conditioning vector to mitigate this undesirable effect. In our framework, the centroid of the cluster to which the visual sample belongs is used as conditioning vector of our conditional adversarial network, where the vector is permutation invariant (clusters ordering does not matter) and its size is independent of the number of clusters. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the use of conditional adversarial networks for unsupervised person re-ID. We evaluate the proposed architecture on top of two state-of-the-art clustering-based unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) methods on four different experimental settings with three different data sets and set the new state-of-the-art performance on all four of them. Our code and model will be made publicly available at https://team.inria.fr/perception/canu-reid/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Person Re-ID: Fantastic Techniques and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05295v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to identify the same person from multiple camera views without the explicit use of facial recognition is receiving commercial and academic interest. The current status-quo solutions are based on attention neural models. In this paper, we propose Attention and CL loss, which is a hybrid of center and Online Soft Mining (OSM) loss added to the attention loss on top of a temporal attention-based neural network. The proposed loss function applied with bag-of-tricks for training surpasses the state of the art on the common person Re-ID datasets, MARS and PRID 2011. Our source code is publicly available on github.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 Pag...</summary><p>2 Page (Student Abstract) accepted in AAAI-20</p></details> |

| **[SAEdit: Token-level control for continuous image editing via Sparse AutoEncoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05081v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://ronen94.github.io/SAEdit/</p></details> |
| **[TBStar-Edit: From Image Editing Pattern Shifting to Consistency Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04483v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains. However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoEdit: Towards Temporal Reasoning for Image Editing and World Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04290v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit will be released on the project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> |
| **[Let Features Decide Their Own Solvers: Hybrid Feature Caching for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04188v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56 times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-to-Prompt: Text-Based Image Editing Via Cross-Attention Mechanisms -- The Research of Hyperparameters and Novel Mechanisms to Enhance Existing Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04034v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results, such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention mechanisms, which significantly influence the composition and quality of the generated images.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Filters to VLMs: Benchmarking Defogging Methods through Object Detection and Segmentation Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03906v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rare Text Semantics Were Always There in Your Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03886v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Starting from flow- and diffusion-based transformers, Multi-modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs) have reshaped text-to-vision generation, gaining acclaim for exceptional visual fidelity. As these models advance, users continually push the boundary with imaginative or rare prompts, which advanced models still falter in generating, since their concepts are often too scarce to leave a strong imprint during pre-training. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective intervention that surfaces rare semantics inside MM-DiTs without additional training steps, data, denoising-time optimization, or reliance on external modules (e.g., large language models). In particular, the joint-attention mechanism intrinsic to MM-DiT sequentially updates text embeddings alongside image embeddings throughout transformer blocks. We find that by mathematically expanding representational basins around text token embeddings via variance scale-up before the joint-attention blocks, rare semantics clearly emerge in MM-DiT's outputs. Furthermore, our results generalize effectively across text-to-vision tasks, including text-to-image, text-to-video, and text-driven image editing. Our work invites generative models to reveal the semantics that users intend, once hidden yet ready to surface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[MedEBench: Diagnosing Reliability in Text-Guided Medical Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01921v7)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing has seen significant progress in natural image domains, but its application in medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation frameworks. Such editing could revolutionize clinical practices by enabling personalized surgical planning, enhancing medical education, and improving patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench1, a robust benchmark designed to diagnose reliability in text-guided medical image editing. MedEBench consists of 1,182 clinically curated image-prompt pairs covering 70 distinct editing tasks and 13 anatomical regions. It contributes in three key areas: (1) a clinically grounded evaluation framework that measures Editing Accuracy, Context Preservation, and Visual Quality, complemented by detailed descriptions of intended edits and corresponding Region-of-Interest (ROI) masks; (2) a comprehensive comparison of seven state-of-theart models, revealing consistent patterns of failure; and (3) a diagnostic error analysis technique that leverages attention alignment, using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between model attention maps and ROI masks to identify mislocalization issues, where models erroneously focus on incorrect anatomical regions. MedEBench sets the stage for developing more reliable and clinically effective text-guided medical image editing tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://mliuby.github.io/MedEBench_Website/</p></details> |
| **[RoboSwap: A GAN-driven Video Diffusion Framework For Unsupervised Robot Arm Swapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08632v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Follow-Your-Shape: Shape-Aware Image Editing via Trajectory-Guided Region Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08134v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://follow-your-shape.github.io/</p></details> |

Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO image conditioning. To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories, demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset spanning thousands of product categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |
| **[OTR: Synthesizing Overlay Text Dataset for Text Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02787v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyberagent/OTR .</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of the work.

| **[DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences. The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed. In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAMILA: Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19731v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize images through natural language instructions, offering considerable flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment). CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[EditTrack: Detecting and Attributing AI-assisted Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01173v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we formulate and study the problem of image-editing detection and attribution: given a base image and a suspicious image, detection seeks to determine whether the suspicious image was derived from the base image using an AI editing model, while attribution further identifies the specific editing model responsible. Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated images are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether an image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a particular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first framework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on four key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel re-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to determine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so, by which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models across six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate detection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlobCtrl: Taming Controllable Blob for Element-level Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13434v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As user expectations for image editing continue to rise, the demand for flexible, fine-grained manipulation of specific visual elements presents a challenge for current diffusion-based methods. In this work, we present BlobCtrl, a framework for element-level image editing based on a probabilistic blob-based representation. Treating blobs as visual primitives, BlobCtrl disentangles layout from appearance, affording fine-grained, controllable object-level manipulation. Our key contributions are twofold: (1) an in-context dual-branch diffusion model that separates foreground and background processing, incorporating blob representations to explicitly decouple layout and appearance, and (2) a self-supervised disentangle-then-reconstruct training paradigm with an identity-preserving loss function, along with tailored strategies to efficiently leverage blob-image pairs. To foster further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench, a benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that BlobCtrl achieves state-of-the-art performance in a variety of element-level editing tasks, such as object addition, removal, scaling, and replacement, while maintaining computational efficiency.

| **[DIA: The Adversarial Exposure of Deterministic Inversion in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00778v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive, as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier, centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift. Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of RL in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, Models and benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/EditScore</p></details> |

Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream, and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench, ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality image editing training datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25845v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward hacking.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image. However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content manipulation across frames.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, most drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of 3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits, particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3) resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors, GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision, structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .</p></details> |  |

We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA) mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to prior multi-step methods.

We present QL-Adapter, a framework for multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and significantly outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |

However, there is significant concern about the potential misuse of these methods, especially in creating misleading or harmful content. Although recent defense strategies, which introduce imperceptible adversarial noise to induce model failure, have shown promise, they remain ineffective against more sophisticated manipulations, such as editing with a mask. In this work, we propose DiffusionGuard, a robust and effective defense method against unauthorized edits by diffusion-based image editing models, even in challenging setups. Through a detailed analysis of these models, we introduce a novel objective that generates adversarial noise targeting the early stage of the diffusion process. This approach significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of adversarial noises. We also introduce a mask-augmentation technique to enhance robustness against various masks during test time. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of methods in protecting against privacy threats in realistic scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves stronger protection and improved mask robustness with lower computational costs compared to the strongest baseline. Additionally, our method exhibits superior transferability and better resilience to noise removal techniques compared to all baseline methods.

However, traditional methods struggle when source and target domains differ, as in domain adaptation, due to their inability to address domain gaps. This paper introduces GenMix, a generalizable prompt-guided generative data augmentation approach that enhances both in-domain and cross-domain image classification. Our technique leverages image editing to generate augmented images based on custom conditional prompts, designed specifically for each problem type. By blending portions of the input image with its edited generative counterpart and incorporating fractal patterns, our approach mitigates unrealistic images and label ambiguity, improving the performance and adversarial robustness of the resulting models. Efficacy of our method is established with extensive experiments on eight public datasets for general and fine-grained classification, in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Additionally, we demonstrate performance improvements for self-supervised learning, learning with data scarcity, and adversarial robustness. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods, our technique achieves stronger performance across the board.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://diffusemix.github.io/</p></details> |

We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications.

Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code, datasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this field.

Although recent generative models have shown remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing task.

Existing methods rely on supervised learning with triplets of input images, ground-truth edited images, and edit instructions. These triplets are typically generated either by existing editing methods, introducing biases, or through human annotations, which are costly and limit generalization. Our approach addresses these challenges by introducing a novel editing mechanism called Edit Reversibility Constraint (ERC), which applies forward and reverse edits in one training step and enforces alignment in image, text, and attention spaces. This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth edited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising either real image-caption pairs or image-caption-instruction triplets. We empirically show that our approach performs better across a broader range of edits with high-fidelity and precision. By eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets of triplets, reducing biases associated with current methods, and proposing ERC, our work represents a significant advancement in unblocking scaling of instruction-based image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV'25.

| **[Reasoning to Edit: Hypothetical Instruction-Based Image Editing with Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01908v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our dataset and code will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Draw-In-Mind: Rebalancing Designer-Painter Roles in Unified Multimodal Models Benefits Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01986v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing. Our dataset and models are available at https://github.com/showlab/DIM.</p></details> | Tech Report |

These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on distinct long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming Flow-based I2V Models for Creative Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21917v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing, which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to realize visual creativity.</p></details> |  |
| **[TDEdit: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Text-Drag Guided Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21905v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations: text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing, integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising, dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to reproduce all results presented in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoHumansRequired: Autonomous High-Quality Image Editing Triplet Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14119v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets (original image, instruction, edited image), yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approx. 2.6x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit, an open dataset of 720k high-quality triplets, curated at industrial scale via millions of guided generations and validator passes, and we analyze the pipeline's stage-wise survival rates, providing a framework for estimating computational effort across different model stacks. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, a fine-tuned Bagel model with state-of-the-art metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

However, existing image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose \textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information. Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

This compromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models, suppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper, we introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on implicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit correspondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the attention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable full-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing task. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability of models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with text guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach: opening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects like a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes like moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round workflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the DragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual quality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only establishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to editing paradigms.</p></details> |  |

Beyond image guidance, recent studies have explored incorporating text guidance to achieve identity-preserved yet locally editable object inpainting. However, these methods still suffer from identity overfitting, where original attributes remain entangled with target textual instructions. To overcome this limitation, we propose DreamMix, a diffusion-based framework adept at inserting target objects into user-specified regions while concurrently enabling arbitrary text-driven attribute modifications. DreamMix introduces three key components: (i) an Attribute Decoupling Mechanism (ADM) that synthesizes diverse attribute-augmented image-text pairs to mitigate overfitting; (ii) a Textual Attribute Substitution (TAS) module that isolates target attributes via orthogonal decomposition, and (iii) a Disentangled Inpainting Framework (DIF) that seperates local generation from global harmonization. Extensive experiments across multiple inpainting backbones demonstrate that DreamMix achieves a superior balance between identity preservation and attribute editability across diverse applications, including object insertion, attribute editing, and small object inpainting.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference. These advances establish Lavida-O as a new paradigm for scalable multimodal reasoning and generation.</p></details> | 31 pages, 15 figures |

However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.</p></details> | Technical Report |

We address this by proposing ICEdit, which leverages the inherent comprehension and generation abilities of large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through three key innovations: (1) An in-context editing paradigm without architectural modifications; (2) Minimal parameter-efficient fine-tuning for quality improvement; (3) Early Filter Inference-Time Scaling, which uses VLMs to select high-quality noise samples for efficiency. Experiments show that ICEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance with only 0.1\% of the training data and 1\% trainable parameters compared to previous methods. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for balancing precision and efficiency in instructional image editing.

| **[GeoRemover: Removing Objects and Their Causal Visual Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18538v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections. However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation, we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks.

Prior methods face challenges with data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting. Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[FOCUS: Unified Vision-Language Modeling for Interactive Editing Driven by Referential Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16806v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Transport for Rectified Flow Image Editing: Unifying Inversion-Based and Direct Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02363v2)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image editing in rectified flow models remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility. While inversion-based methods suffer from trajectory deviation, recent inversion-free approaches like FlowEdit offer direct editing pathways but can benefit from additional guidance to improve structure preservation. In this work, we demonstrate that optimal transport theory provides a unified framework for improving both paradigms in rectified flow editing. We introduce a zero-shot transport-guided inversion framework that leverages optimal transport during the reverse diffusion process, and extend optimal transport principles to enhance inversion-free methods through transport-optimized velocity field corrections. Incorporating transport-based guidance can effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability across different rectified flow editing approaches. For inversion-based editing, our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, observing 7.8% to 12.9% improvements over RF-Inversion on LSUN datasets. For inversion-free editing with FlowEdit on FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic consistency and structure preservation across diverse editing scenarios. Our semantic face editing experiments show an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and enhanced perceptual quality. The unified optimal transport framework produces visually compelling edits with superior detail preservation across both inversion-based and direct editing paradigms.

Our framework utilizes a pre-trained image editing diffusion model, and operates without access to the internals of the classifier, leading to an explainable counterfactual generation process.

Despite their remarkable advancements, diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically, End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

To get the reasonable editing performance, these methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification, \textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework, which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse and challenging IBIE capabilities.

Existing local explainability methods focus on associations, neglecting the causal drivers of model predictions. Other approaches adopt a causal perspective but primarily provide global, model-level explanations. However, for specific inputs, it's unclear whether globally identified factors apply locally. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for local interventional explanations by leveraging recent advances in image-to-image editing models. Our approach performs gradual interventions on semantic properties to quantify the corresponding impact on a model's predictions using a novel score, the expected property gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation on a wide range of architectures and tasks. First, we validate it in a synthetic scenario and demonstrate its ability to locally identify biases. Afterward, we apply our approach to investigate medical skin lesion classifiers, analyze network training dynamics, and study a pre-trained CLIP model with real-life interventional data. Our results highlight the potential of interventional explanations on the property level to reveal new insights into the behavior of deep models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV-2026, 45 pages, 39 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Controllable-Continuous Color Editing in Diffusion Model via Color Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13756v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress. However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language, color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.</p></details> |  |

Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.</p></details> | 13 pages,12 figures |

LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks.

Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time. Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

However, real-world user instructions are immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge. Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM, equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

However, such methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description, without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt. Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while remaining imperceptible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Regular Paper at ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |

Automated image interpretation may reduce radiologists\' workload and expand access to diagnostic expertise. Deep learning multi-task and foundation models have shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations rather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce RoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically realistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving unrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an open-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image modification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with board-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images appeared realistic in 93\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified finding in 89-99\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real follow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task and foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts, limiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual images during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model discrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\% AUC in internal validation and by 1-11\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These findings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and correcting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled counterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and interpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable strategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 + ...</summary><p>25 + 8 pages, 4 + 7 figures</p></details> |

DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to text-to-image editing tasks.

However, current TIE models still struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes 1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+ question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner. Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and aligns well with human preference.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at 512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification, automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance.

| **[From Editor to Dense Geometry Estimator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04338v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning. Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts. Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks. Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other. Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

| **[Improved 3D Scene Stylization via Text-Guided Generative Image Editing with Region-Based Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05285v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views. Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism, which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally, inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene. Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel approach to automating the image editing process using program synthesis. We propose a new algorithm based on lattice structures to automatically synthesize object selection predicates for image editing from positive and negative examples. By leveraging the algebraic properties of lattices, our algorithm efficiently synthesizes an optimal object selection predicate among multiple correct solutions. We have implemented our technique and evaluated it on 100 tasks over 20 images.

| **[Discrete Noise Inversion for Next-scale Autoregressive Text-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01984v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.</p></details> | update affiliation |

We propose a plug-and-play (PnP) framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided image editing using foundational diffusion models. By employing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), our approach ensures consensus between data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts for removal in natural language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets show significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity, validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction pattern consistency. This work highlights the combination of text-guided generative models and model-based phase retrieval algorithms as a transferable and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Scene Designer: Self-Styled Semantic Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01405v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics, and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight, plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps. Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PRCV 2025</p></details> |

However, accurately localizing the manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization. Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1 average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/qcf-568/MIML.</p></details> |  |

Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion. Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it improves editing accuracy and consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits.

However, contemporary methods face challenges in capturing the precise semantics conveyed by complex multi-object prompts. Consequently, many works have sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via inference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising networks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the cosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations, which are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a case study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with objects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation. Our analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that faithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color prompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. Accordingly, we introduce a dedicated image editing technique, mitigating the issue of multi-object semantic alignment for prompts containing multiple colors. We demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts performance over a wide range of metrics, considering images generated by various text-to-image diffusion-based techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://tau-vailab.github.io/color-edit/</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Text Embedding Leakage in Diffusion-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04715v4)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based image editing, powered by generative diffusion models, lets users modify images through natural-language prompts and has dramatically simplified traditional workflows. Despite these advances, current methods still suffer from a critical problem: attribute leakage, where edits meant for specific objects unintentionally affect unrelated regions or other target objects. Our analysis reveals the root cause as the semantic entanglement inherent in End-of-Sequence (EOS) embeddings generated by autoregressive text encoders, which indiscriminately aggregate attributes across prompts. To address this issue, we introduce Attribute-Leakage-free Editing (ALE), a framework that tackles attribute leakage at its source. ALE combines Object-Restricted Embeddings (ORE) to disentangle text embeddings, Region-Guided Blending for Cross-Attention Masking (RGB-CAM) for spatially precise attention, and Background Blending (BB) to preserve non-edited content. To quantitatively evaluate attribute leakage across various editing methods, we propose the Attribute-Leakage Evaluation Benchmark (ALE-Bench), featuring comprehensive editing scenarios and new metrics. Extensive experiments show that ALE reduces attribute leakage by large margins, thereby enabling accurate, multi-object, text-driven image editing while faithfully preserving non-target content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Key challenges include granular instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications, and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative, and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop. To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and 3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.</p></details> |  |

While most existing detection methods primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE SMC 2025</p></details> |

As generative models continue to scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation, highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising, positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its practical value and potential for broad adoption.</p></details> |  |

However, their global denoising process inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer. VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a $512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the similarly sized UltraEdit.

While recent inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose image editing.

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code: http://http://geometrylearning.com/Sketch3DVE/</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2025 |

However, it is still challenging to directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions. To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models without further training.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving fine-grained age editing while preserving personal identity remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial aging. Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset (High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes. Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.</p></details> |  |

And further decompose them into 31 fine-grained tasks covering a broad spectrum of image generation requirements, culminating in a comprehensive benchmark. (2) Multi-dimensional Metrics: The evaluation framework assesses image generation capabilities across 6 dimensions: aesthetic quality, imaging quality, prompt following, source consistency, reference consistency, and controllability. 11 metrics are introduced to support the multi-dimensional evaluation. Notably, we introduce VLLM-QA, an innovative metric designed to assess the success of image editing by leveraging large models. (3) Hybrid Data: The data comes from real scenes and virtual generation, which effectively improves data diversity and alleviates the bias problem in model evaluation. Through ICE-Bench, we conduct a thorough analysis of existing generation models, revealing both the challenging nature of our benchmark and the gap between current model capabilities and real-world generation requirements. To foster further advancements in the field, we will open-source ICE-Bench, including its dataset, evaluation code, and models, thereby providing a valuable resource for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages.

To be viable for broad deployment across devices with varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements, highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource constraints. Codes are accessible at https://github.com/ForawardStar/EdgeDetectionviaPEdgerPlus/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborating with AI Agents: Field Experiments on Teamwork, Productivity, and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18238v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce Pairit -- an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces. In a large-scale marketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned to human-human and human-AI teams. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages and created 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated images while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of fine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that collaborating with AI agents increased communication by 63% and allowed humans to engage in 71% less direct text editing. While human-AI teams engaged in 18% more process and content communication, human-human teams engaged in 29% more social and emotional communication. Humans in human-AI teams experienced 73% greater productivity per worker and produced higher-quality ad copy, while human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. Field tests of the ad campaigns accumulated ~5M ad impressions and revealed that ads with higher image quality (produced by human-human collaborations) and higher text quality (produced by human-AI collaborations) performed significantly better on click-through rates, view through rates, and cost per click metrics. Together, these results suggest that human collaboration with AI agents significantly reshapes communication patterns and work processes and increases productivity, while improving some dimensions of output quality and deteriorating others. We hope the release of the extensible Pairit platform will accelerate RCTs of human-AI collaboration across a variety of work tasks and contexts.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 figures |

However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset. First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed method. The code of the project is available at https://github.com/Jay-xyj/SBDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[TweezeEdit: Consistent and Efficient Image Editing with Path Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10498v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors, ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only 12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

We propose TIDE-Temporal-aware sparse autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs-a framework designed to extract sparse, interpretable activation features across timesteps in DiTs. TIDE effectively captures temporally-varying representations and reveals that DiTs naturally learn hierarchical semantics (e.g., 3D structure, object class, and fine-grained concepts) during large-scale pretraining. Experiments show that TIDE enhances interpretability and controllability while maintaining reasonable generation quality, enabling applications such as safe image editing and style transfer.</p></details> |  |

While prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15 participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy, and user-centric deepfake forensics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM ICMI 2025 Demos</p></details> |

Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPIE: Semantic and Structural Post-Training of Image Editing Diffusion Models with AI feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12833v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents SPIE: a novel approach for semantic and structural post-training of instruction-based image editing diffusion models, addressing key challenges in alignment with user prompts and consistency with input images. We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the alignment with instructions and realism in two ways. First, SPIE captures fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. Second, it achieves precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIE can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where targeted image edits enhance the visual realism of simulated environments, which improves their utility as proxy for real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The open-source code, checkpoints, and datasets for X2Edit can be found at the following link: https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/X2Edit.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/X2Edit</p></details> |

While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity, while maintaining visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Multimodal Diffusion Transformers for Enhanced Prompt-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07519v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks, revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

In this paper, in addition to leveraging distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly available at https://github.com/SZAISEC/CLUE.</p></details> |  |

The ambiguity and entanglement of these embeddings pose challenges for precise editing. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of text embeddings in Stable Diffusion XL, offering three key insights: (1) \textit{aug embedding}~\footnote{\textit{aug embedding} is obtained by combining the pooled output of the final text encoder with the timestep embeddings. https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers} retains complete textual semantics but contributes minimally to image generation as it is only fused via the ResBlocks. More text information weakens its local semantics while preserving most global semantics. (2) \textit{BOS} and \textit{padding embedding} do not contain any semantic information. (3) \textit{EOS} holds the semantic information of all words and stylistic information. Each word embedding is important and does not interfere with the semantic injection of other embeddings. Based on these insights, we propose PSP (\textbf{P}rompt-\textbf{S}oftbox-\textbf{P}rompt), a training-free image editing method that leverages free-text embedding. PSP enables precise image editing by modifying text embeddings within the cross-attention layers and using Softbox to control the specific area for semantic injection. This technique enables the addition and replacement of objects without affecting other areas of the image. Additionally, PSP can achieve style transfer by simply replacing text embeddings. Extensive experiments show that PSP performs remarkably well in tasks such as object replacement, object addition, and style transfer. Our code is available at https://github.com/yangyt46/PSP.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |

However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits. We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2) Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for competitor methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: vaynexie.github.io/CannyEdit/</p></details> |

This work advances CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score. Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Main</p></details> |

The primary challenge is the intra-class differences, encompassing intra-modal feature variations and cross-modal semantic gaps. Prior works have focused on instance-level samples and ignored prototypical features of each person which are intrinsic and invariant. Toward this, we propose a Cross-Modal Prototypical Contrastive Learning (CPCL) method. In practice, the CPCL introduces the CLIP model to weakly supervised text-based person retrieval to map visual and textual instances into a shared latent space. Subsequently, the proposed Prototypical Multi-modal Memory (PMM) module captures associations between heterogeneous modalities of image-text pairs belonging to the same person through the Hybrid Cross-modal Matching (HCM) module in a many-to-many mapping fashion. Moreover, the Outlier Pseudo Label Mining (OPLM) module further distinguishes valuable outlier samples from each modality, enhancing the creation of more reliable clusters by mining implicit relationships between image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks of weakly supervised text-based person retrieval, which validate the effectiveness, generalizability of CPCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, under peer review</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing the Pretraining Gap: Domain-aligned Text-Based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10195v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements. However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color, and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components, i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain, e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity. Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets, outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/MRA.</p></details> |  |

It presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures. Under review</p></details> |
| **[CAMeL: Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18782v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations.

| **[TVPR: Text-to-Video Person Retrieval and a New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07184v3)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing methods for text-based person retrieval focus on text-to-image person retrieval. Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset. The TVPReid dataset will be publicly available to benefit future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[UP-Person: Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10084v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) as a multi-modal task, which aims to retrieve the target person from a pool of candidate images given a text description, has recently garnered considerable attention due to the progress of contrastive visual-language pre-trained model. Prior works leverage pre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully fine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements compared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model is prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method for Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the multi-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously integrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and Adapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information with task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust global feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are optimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix is proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation of prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla prefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer normalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts caused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art results across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\% parameters.

Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures |

Tailoring CLIP to person domain is now a emerging research topic due to the abundant knowledge of vision-language pretraining, but challenges still remain during fine-tuning: (i) Previous full-model fine-tuning in TPR is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.(ii) Existing parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for TPR lacks of fine-grained feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose Domain-Aware Mixture-of-Adapters (DM-Adapter), which unifies Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and PETL to enhance fine-grained feature representations while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, Sparse Mixture-of-Adapters is designed in parallel to MLP layers in both vision and language branches, where different experts specialize in distinct aspects of person knowledge to handle features more finely. To promote the router to exploit domain information effectively and alleviate the routing imbalance, Domain-Aware Router is then developed by building a novel gating function and injecting learnable domain-aware prompts. Extensive experiments show that our DM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-path Exploration and Feedback Adjustment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21318v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to identify the specific persons using textual descriptions as queries. Existing ad vanced methods typically depend on vision-language pre trained (VLP) models to facilitate effective cross-modal alignment. However, the inherent constraints of VLP mod-els, which include the global alignment biases and insuffi-cient self-feedback regulation, impede optimal retrieval per formance. In this paper, we propose MeFa, a Multi-Pathway Exploration, Feedback, and Adjustment framework, which deeply explores intrinsic feedback of intra and inter-modal to make targeted adjustment, thereby achieving more precise person-text associations. Specifically, we first design an intra modal reasoning pathway that generates hard negative sam ples for cross-modal data, leveraging feedback from these samples to refine intra-modal reasoning, thereby enhancing sensitivity to subtle discrepancies. Subsequently, we intro duce a cross-modal refinement pathway that utilizes both global information and intermodal feedback to refine local in formation, thus enhancing its global semantic representation. Finally, the discriminative clue correction pathway incorpo rates fine-grained features of secondary similarity as discrim inative clues to further mitigate retrieval failures caused by disparities in these features. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that MeFa achieves superior person retrieval performance without necessitating additional data or complex structures.</p></details> |  |

Despite considerable efforts to bridge the gap between vision and language, the significant differences between these modalities continue to pose a challenge. Previous methods have attempted to align text and image samples in a modal-shared space, but they face uncertainties in optimization directions due to the movable features of both modalities and the failure to account for one-to-many relationships of image-text pairs in TPR datasets. To address this issue, we propose an effective bi-directional one-to-many embedding paradigm that offers a clear optimization direction for each sample, thus mitigating the optimization problem. Additionally, this embedding scheme generates multiple features for each sample without introducing trainable parameters, making it easier to align with several positive samples. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel Bi-directional one-to-many Embedding Alignment (Beat) model to address the TPR task. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Beat model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular TPR datasets, including CUHK-PEDES (65.61 R@1), ICFG-PEDES (58.25 R@1), and RSTPReID (48.10 R@1). Furthermore, additional experiments on MS-COCO, CUB, and Flowers datasets further demonstrate the potential of Beat to be applied to other image-text retrieval tasks.</p></details> | ACM MM2023 |

This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem, we contribute a new benchmark named \textbf{UFineBench} for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly, we construct a new \textbf{dataset} named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions, averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation, we also propose a special \textbf{evaluation paradigm} more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains, cross textual granularity and cross textual styles, named UFine3C, and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability, named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover, we propose CFAM, a more efficient \textbf{algorithm} especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation, CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets, especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore, by evaluating on UFine3C, we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Zplusdragon/UFineBench}.</p></details> |  |

It supports multimodal tasks, including text-based person retrieval and human matching. One of the most significant challenges faced in Re-ID is clothes-changing, where the same person may appear in different outfits. While previous methods have made notable progress in maintaining clothing data consistency and handling clothing change data, they still rely excessively on clothing information, which can limit performance due to the dynamic nature of human appearances. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Pose-Guidance Deep Supervision (PGDS), an effective framework for learning pose guidance within the Re-ID task. It consists of three modules: a human encoder, a pose encoder, and a Pose-to-Human Projection module (PHP). Our framework guides the human encoder, i.e., the main re-identification model, with pose information from the pose encoder through multiple layers via the knowledge transfer mechanism from the PHP module, helping the human encoder learn body parts information without increasing computation resources in the inference stage. Through extensive experiments, our method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness for real-world applications.

The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training. However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets. This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR. LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information. In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training. LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR models. Comprehensive experiments on three TPR benchmarks show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models.</p></details> |  |

To close the gap, we study the problem of text-based person search in full images by proposing a new end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimize the pedestrian detection, identification and visual-semantic feature embedding tasks. To take full advantage of the query text, the semantic features are leveraged to instruct the Region Proposal Network to pay more attention to the text-described proposals. Besides, a cross-scale visual-semantic embedding mechanism is utilized to improve the performance. To validate the proposed method, we collect and annotate two large-scale benchmark datasets based on the widely adopted image-based person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets and compared with the baseline methods, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge lies in bridging the substantial gap between vision and language modalities, especially when dealing with limited large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a CLIP-based Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (CSKT) approach for TPR. Specifically, to explore the CLIP's knowledge on input side, we first propose a Bidirectional Prompts Transferring (BPT) module constructed by text-to-image and image-to-text bidirectional prompts and coupling projections. Secondly, Dual Adapters Transferring (DAT) is designed to transfer knowledge on output side of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in vision and language. This synergistic two-way collaborative mechanism promotes the early-stage feature fusion and efficiently exploits the existing knowledge of CLIP. CSKT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across three benchmark datasets when the training parameters merely account for 7.4% of the entire model, demonstrating its remarkable efficiency, effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP2024(accepted). minor typos revision compared to version 1 in arxiv</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset named PRW-TPS-CN based on the widely used person search dataset PRW. Our dataset contains 47,102 sentences, which means there is quite more information than existing dataset. These texts precisely describe the person images from top to bottom, which in line with the natural description order. We also provide both Chinese and English descriptions in our dataset for more comprehensive evaluation. These characteristics make our dataset more applicable. To alleviate the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval, we take advantage of the rich texts in PRW-TPS-CN dataset. We propose to aggregate multiple texts as text prototypes to maintain the prominent text features of a person, which can better reflect the whole character of a person. The overall prototypes lead to generating the image attention map to eliminate the detection misalignment causing the decrease of text-based person retrieval. Thus, the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval is largely alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments on the PRW-TPS-CN dataset. The experimental results show the PRW-TPS-CN dataset's effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

In particular, MALS contains 1,510,330 image-text pairs, which is about 37.5 times larger than prevailing CUHK-PEDES, and all images are annotated with 27 attributes. Considering the privacy concerns and annotation costs, we leverage the off-the-shelf diffusion models to generate the dataset. To verify the feasibility of learning from the generated data, we develop a new joint Attribute Prompt Learning and Text Matching Learning (APTM) framework, considering the shared knowledge between attribute and text. As the name implies, APTM contains an attribute prompt learning stream and a text matching learning stream. (1) The attribute prompt learning leverages the attribute prompts for image-attribute alignment, which enhances the text matching learning. (2) The text matching learning facilitates the representation learning on fine-grained details, and in turn, boosts the attribute prompt learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the pre-training on MALS, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance via APTM on three challenging real-world benchmarks. In particular, APTM achieves a consistent improvement of +6.96%, +7.68%, and +16.95% Recall@1 accuracy on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets by a clear margin, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Many previous approaches contrive to learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a \textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When mapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common manifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely invisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus so as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal common manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of the actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal data can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we propose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common Manifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our method, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\textit{san si er hou xing}', namely, to \textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping mechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to CDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the visual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality into C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on two text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05773</p></details> |

Existing methods generally face a \textbf{color over-reliance problem}, which means that the models rely heavily on color information when matching cross-modal data. Indeed, color information is an important decision-making accordance for retrieval, but the over-reliance on color would distract the model from other key clues (e.g. texture information, structural information, etc.), and thereby lead to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to \textbf{C}apture \textbf{A}ll-round \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}eyond \textbf{C}olor (\textbf{CAIBC}) via a jointly optimized multi-branch architecture for text-based person retrieval. CAIBC contains three branches including an RGB branch, a grayscale (GRS) branch and a color (CLR) branch. Besides, with the aim of making full use of all-round information in a balanced and effective way, a mutual learning mechanism is employed to enable the three branches which attend to varied aspects of information to communicate with and learn from each other. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to evaluate our proposed CAIBC method on the CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets in both \textbf{supervised} and \textbf{weakly supervised} text-based person retrieval settings, which demonstrates that CAIBC significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all the three tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22</p></details> |

The key is to learn a common latent space mapping between visual-textual modalities. To achieve this goal, existing works employ segmentation to obtain explicitly cross-modal alignments or utilize attention to explore salient alignments. These methods have two shortcomings: 1) Labeling cross-modal alignments are time-consuming. 2) Attention methods can explore salient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs. To relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT) framework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT utilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which contributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained alignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms: multi-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA module explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the BMM module aims to mine \textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and textual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES. Even without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of high-dimensional data, the unconstrained mapping paradigms are not able to properly catch discriminative clues about the corresponding person while drop the misaligned information. Intuitively, the information contained in visual data can be divided into person information (PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each other. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person information, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A surroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to realize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a mutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and multi-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse alignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only accessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES.

In this paper we propose a person retrieval system that uses textual queries (e.g., "black trousers and green shirt") as descriptions and a one-class generative color model with outlier filtering to represent the images both to train the models and to perform the search. The method is evaluated in terms of its efficiency in fulfilling the needs of a forensic retrieval system: limited annotation, robustness, extensibility, adaptability and computational cost. The proposed generative method is compared to a corresponding discriminative approach. Experiments are carried out using a range of queries in three different databases. The experiments show that the two evaluated algorithms provide average retrieval performance and adaptable to new datasets. The proposed generative algorithm has some advantages over the discriminative one, specifically its capability to work with very few training samples and its much lower computational requirements when the number of training examples increases.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multiple Information Prompt Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00330v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification is a subject closer to the real world, which focuses on solving the problem of person re-identification after pedestrians change clothes. The primary challenge in this field is to overcome the complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to identify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient data collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this problem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice. Current methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the original image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely limited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional model. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel multiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person ReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance of multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS) module is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB image features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The Bio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning intensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP) module is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the impact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID, Celeb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%, 66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively. When compared to AIM (CVPR23), ACID (TIP23), and SCNet (MM23), MIPL achieves rank-1 improvements of 11.3%, 13.8%, and 7.9%, respectively, on the PRCC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Clothes Changing Person ReID: Conflicts, Synthesis, and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12611v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same person wearing different outfits. Mainstream researches focus on designing advanced model structures and strategies to capture identity information independent of clothing. However, the same-clothes discrimination as the standard ReID learning objective in CC-ReID is persistently ignored in previous researches. In this study, we dive into the relationship between standard and clothes-changing~(CC) learning objectives, and bring the inner conflicts between these two objectives to the fore. We try to magnify the proportion of CC training pairs by supplementing high-fidelity clothes-varying synthesis, produced by our proposed Clothes-Changing Diffusion model. By incorporating the synthetic images into CC-ReID model training, we observe a significant improvement under CC protocol. However, such improvement sacrifices the performance under the standard protocol, caused by the inner conflict between standard and CC. For conflict mitigation, we decouple these objectives and re-formulate CC-ReID learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. By effectively regularizing the gradient curvature across multiple objectives and introducing preference restrictions, our MOO solution surpasses the single-task training paradigm. Our framework is model-agnostic, and demonstrates superior performance under both CC and standard ReID protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEFF: Improving Any Clothes-Changing Person ReID Model using Gallery Enrichment with Face Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13807v2)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) problem, given a query sample of a person, the goal is to determine the correct identity based on a labeled gallery in which the person appears in different clothes. Several models tackle this challenge by extracting clothes-independent features. However, the performance of these models is still lower for the clothes-changing setting compared to the same-clothes setting in which the person appears with the same clothes in the labeled gallery. As clothing-related features are often dominant features in the data, we propose a new process we call Gallery Enrichment, to utilize these features. In this process, we enrich the original gallery by adding to it query samples based on their face features, using an unsupervised algorithm. Additionally, we show that combining ReID and face feature extraction modules alongside an enriched gallery results in a more accurate ReID model, even for query samples with new outfits that do not include faces. Moreover, we claim that existing CC-ReID benchmarks do not fully represent real-world scenarios, and propose a new video CC-ReID dataset called 42Street, based on a theater play that includes crowded scenes and numerous clothes changes. When applied to multiple ReID models, our method (GEFF) achieves an average improvement of 33.5% and 6.7% in the Top-1 clothes-changing metric on the PRCC and LTCC benchmarks. Combined with the latest ReID models, our method achieves new SOTA results on the PRCC, LTCC, CCVID, LaST and VC-Clothes benchmarks and the proposed 42Street dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08387v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2108.04527</p></details> |
| **[Identity-Guided Collaborative Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04400v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information), cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised clothing change adaptive person ReID](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03702v2)** | 2021-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothing changes and lack of data labels are both crucial challenges in person ReID. For the former challenge, people may occur multiple times at different locations wearing different clothing. However, most of the current person ReID research works focus on the benchmarks in which a person's clothing is kept the same all the time. For the last challenge, some researchers try to make model learn information from a labeled dataset as a source to an unlabeled dataset. Whereas purely unsupervised training is less used. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems at the same time. We design a novel unsupervised model, Sync-Person-Cloud ReID, to solve the unsupervised clothing change person ReID problem. We developer a purely unsupervised clothing change person ReID pipeline with person sync augmentation operation and same person feature restriction. The person sync augmentation is to supply additional same person resources. These same person's resources can be used as part supervised input by same person feature restriction. The extensive experiments on clothing change ReID datasets show the out-performance of our methods.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Multigranular Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04527v1)** | 2021-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail. To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task, but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme (MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic information that is used to align the human attributes.</p></details> |  |

| **[Inverse Virtual Try-On: Generating Multi-Category Product-Style Images from Clothed Individuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21062v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF), which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i) difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses, often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the target garments.</p></details> |  |

However, there is a gap between current research progress and commercial applications and an absence of comprehensive overview of this field to accelerate the development.In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies in aspects of pipeline architecture, person representation and key modules such as try-on indication, clothing warping and try-on stage. We additionally apply CLIP to assess the semantic alignment of try-on results, and evaluate representative methods with uniformly implemented evaluation metrics on the same dataset.In addition to quantitative and qualitative evaluation of current open-source methods, unresolved issues are highlighted and future research directions are prospected to identify key trends and inspire further exploration. The uniformly implemented evaluation metrics, dataset and collected methods will be made public available at https://github.com/little-misfit/Survey-Of-Virtual-Try-On.</p></details> | 30 pages, 20 figures |

Unlike existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer, which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[DS-VTON: An Enhanced Dual-Scale Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00908v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures and patterns. These two requirements map directly onto a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, where the coarse stage handles structural alignment and the fine stage recovers rich garment details. Motivated by this observation, we propose DS-VTON, an enhanced dual-scale coarse-to-fine framework that tackles the try-on problem more effectively. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment. In the second stage, a blend-refine diffusion process reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between scales through noise-image blending, emphasizing texture fidelity and effectively correcting fine-detail errors from the low-resolution stage. In addition, our method adopts a fully mask-free generation strategy, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or segmentation masks. Extensive experiments show that DS-VTON not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but consistently and significantly surpasses prior methods in both structural alignment and texture fidelity across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO image conditioning. To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories, demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset spanning thousands of product categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |
| **[IC-Custom: Diverse Image Customization via In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01926v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production, aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However, current approaches conventionally separate image customization into position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We propose the In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism, which employs learnable task-oriented register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to effectively handle diverse tasks and distinguish between inputs in polyptych configurations. To address the data gap, we curated a 12K identity-consistent dataset with 8K real-world and 4K high-quality synthetic samples, avoiding the overly glossy, oversaturated look typical of synthetic data. IC-Custom supports various industrial applications, including try-on, image insertion, and creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves about 73\% higher human preference across identity consistency, harmony, and text alignment metrics, while training only 0.4\% of the original model parameters.

In contrast, editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations, and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media. Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.</p></details> |  |
| **[ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25749v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis, preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions. However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation, leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[UP2You: Fast Reconstruction of Yourself from Unconstrained Photo Collections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24817v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5 minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

Recent video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals, and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset, ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic. ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on our website.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,Project website: https://ctrlhair-arxiv.netlify.app/</p></details> |
| **[MagicTryOn: Harnessing Diffusion Transformer for Garment-Preserving Video Virtual Try-on](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21325v3)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Virtual Try-On (VVT) aims to synthesize garments that appear natural across consecutive video frames, capturing both their dynamics and interactions with human motion. Despite recent progress, existing VVT methods still suffer from inadequate garment fidelity and limited spatiotemporal consistency. The reasons are: (1) under-exploitation of garment information, with limited garment cues being injected, resulting in weaker fine-detail fidelity; and (2) a lack of spatiotemporal modeling, which hampers cross-frame identity consistency and causes temporal jitter and appearance drift. In this paper, we present MagicTryOn, a diffusion-transformer based framework for garment-preserving video virtual try-on. To preserve fine-grained garment details, we propose a fine-grained garment-preservation strategy that disentangles garment cues and injects these decomposed priors into the denoising process. To improve temporal garment consistency and suppress jitter, we introduce a garment-aware spatiotemporal rotary positional embedding (RoPE) that extends RoPE within full self-attention, using spatiotemporal relative positions to modulate garment tokens. We further impose a mask-aware loss during training to enhance fidelity within garment regions. Moreover, we adopt distribution-matching distillation to compress the sampling trajectory to four steps, enabling real-time inference without degrading garment fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MagicTryOn outperforms existing methods, delivering superior garment-detail fidelity and temporal stability in unconstrained settings.</p></details> |  |

A computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Encoder-Free Pose Conditioning and Pose Control for Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20343v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON) technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control. In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |

The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON recorded 92.5%, which is 15.4% better than Leffa in short-sleeved synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github : https://github.com/DevChoco/CAP-VTON</p></details> |

Traditional methods struggle to meet the growing demand due to technical complexity and high resource costs. Learning-based approaches offer faster, more diverse garment synthesis based on specific requirements and reduce human efforts and time costs. However, they still face challenges such as inconsistent multi-view geometry or textures and heavy reliance on detailed garment topology and manual rigging. We propose SemanticGarment, a 3D Gaussian-based method that realizes high-fidelity 3D garment generation from text or image prompts and supports semantic-based interactive editing for flexible user customization. To ensure multi-view consistency and garment fitting, we propose to leverage structural human priors for the generative model by introducing a 3D semantic clothing model, which initializes the geometry structure and lays the groundwork for view-consistent garment generation and editing. Without the need to regenerate or rely on existing mesh templates, our approach allows for rapid and diverse modifications to existing Gaussians, either globally or within a local region. To address the artifacts caused by self-occlusion for garment reconstruction based on single image, we develop a self-occlusion optimization strategy to mitigate holes and artifacts that arise when directly animating self-occluded garments. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate our superior performance in 3D garment generation and editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEFT-VTON: Efficient Virtual Try-On with Consistent Generalised H-Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13506v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods, real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference, serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of 5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 CVPR Workshop</p></details> |

To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence, where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots, cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size, allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not available.</p></details> |  |

In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore, current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.</p></details> |  |

Our VFR models long video generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process, eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data, while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://immortalco.github.io/VirtualFittingRoom/</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Per-Garment Virtual Try-On with Temporal Consistency for Loose-Fitting Garments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12348v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However, these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information, leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address the first limitation, we propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. To address the second limitation, we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent synthesis framework.</p></details> |  |

Our approach requires a single user image and supports a range of tops, bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning network that leverages attention to unify multi-modal inputs (text, images, and videos), thereby enhancing garment registration and motion fidelity. CondNet is trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive manner. Dress&Dance outperforms existing open source and commercial solutions and enables a high quality and flexible try-on experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://immortalco.github.io/DressAndDance/</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead. This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode, and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off'' model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniTry: Virtual Try-On Anything without Masks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13632v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects, e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e., portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage, the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects, with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at https://omnitry.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved perceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details such as logos and printed text elements that are critical for brand integrity and customer trust. In this work, we propose DualFit, a hybrid VTON pipeline that addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage, DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned flow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a fidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the warped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this process, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly around garment seams. Extensive qualitative results show that DualFit achieves visually seamless try-on results while faithfully maintaining high-frequency garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy and perceptual realism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Retai...</summary><p>Retail Vision, ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we present StyleTailor, the first collaborative agent framework that seamlessly unifies personalized apparel design, shopping recommendation, virtual try-on, and systematic evaluation into a cohesive workflow. To this end, StyleTailor pioneers an iterative visual refinement paradigm driven by multi-level negative feedback, enabling adaptive and precise user alignment. Specifically, our framework features two core agents, i.e., Designer for personalized garment selection and Consultant for virtual try-on, whose outputs are progressively refined via hierarchical vision-language model feedback spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy. Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop mechanism that enhances recommendation quality. To assess the performance, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation suite encompassing style consistency, visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.</p></details> | 24pages, 5 figures |
| **[MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization. However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately, rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual try-on applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Undress to Redress: A Training-Free Framework for Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07680v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos. Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority'' completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an ''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment, effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps. Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike Virtual Try-On (VTON), which digitally dresses models, VTOFF extracts canonical garment images, demanding precise reconstruction of shape, texture, and complex patterns, enabling robust evaluation of generative model fidelity. We propose TryOffDiff, adapting Stable Diffusion with SigLIP-based visual conditioning to deliver high-fidelity reconstructions. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TryOffDiff outperforms adapted pose transfer and VTON baselines. We observe that traditional metrics such as SSIM inadequately reflect reconstruction quality, prompting our use of DISTS for reliable assessment. Our findings highlight VTOFF's potential to improve e-commerce product imagery, advance generative model evaluation, and guide future research on high-fidelity reconstruction.

However, the use of text prompts in virtual try-on remains underexplored. This paper tackles a text-editable virtual try-on task that modifies the clothing based on the provided clothing image while editing the wearing style (e.g., tucking style, fit) according to the text descriptions. In the text-editable virtual try-on, three key aspects exist: (i) designing rich text descriptions for paired person-clothing data to train the model, (ii) addressing the conflicts where textual information of the existing person's clothing interferes the generation of the new clothing, and (iii) adaptively adjust the inpainting mask aligned with the text descriptions, ensuring proper editing areas while preserving the original person's appearance irrelevant to the new clothing. To address these aspects, we propose PromptDresser, a text-editable virtual try-on model that leverages large multimodal model (LMM) assistance to enable high-quality and versatile manipulation based on generative text prompts. Our approach utilizes LMMs via in-context learning to generate detailed text descriptions for person and clothing images independently, including pose details and editing attributes using minimal human cost. Moreover, to ensure the editing areas, we adjust the inpainting mask depending on the text prompts adaptively. Our approach enhances text editability while effectively conveying clothing details that are difficult to capture through images alone, leading to improved image quality. Experiments show that PromptDresser significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating superior text-driven control and versatile clothing manipulation.

In this paper, we propose Voost - a unified and scalable framework that jointly learns virtual try-on and try-off with a single diffusion transformer. By modeling both tasks jointly, Voost enables each garment-person pair to supervise both directions and supports flexible conditioning over generation direction and garment category, enhancing garment-body relational reasoning without task-specific networks, auxiliary losses, or additional labels. In addition, we introduce two inference-time techniques: attention temperature scaling for robustness to resolution or mask variation, and self-corrective sampling that leverages bidirectional consistency between tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Voost achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong baselines in alignment accuracy, visual fidelity, and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nxnai.github.io/Voost/</p></details> |
| **[One Model For All: Partial Diffusion for Unified Try-On and Try-Off in Any Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04559v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment, the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis.

| **[Two-Way Garment Transfer: Unified Diffusion Framework for Dressing and Undressing Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04551v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF), which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans, remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting high-quality paired makeup datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://yangxingchao.github.io/FFHQ-Makeup-page, Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyberagent/FFHQ-Makeup</p></details> |

However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images. These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content and temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion, perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading, reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and 2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for realistic and consistent video editing.

Previous research on video try-on has primarily focused on transferring product clothing images to videos with simple human poses, while performing poorly with complex movements. To better preserve clothing details, those approaches are armed with an additional garment encoder, resulting in higher computational resource consumption. The primary challenges in this domain are twofold: (1) leveraging the garment encoder's capabilities in video try-on while lowering computational requirements; (2) ensuring temporal consistency in the synthesis of human body parts, especially during rapid movements. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel video try-on framework based on Diffusion Transformer(DiT), named Dynamic Try-On. To reduce computational overhead, we adopt a straightforward approach by utilizing the DiT backbone itself as the garment encoder and employing a dynamic feature fusion module to store and integrate garment features. To ensure temporal consistency of human body parts, we introduce a limb-aware dynamic attention module that enforces the DiT backbone to focus on the regions of human limbs during the denoising process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Dynamic Try-On in generating stable and smooth try-on results, even for videos featuring complicated human postures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhengjun-ai.github.io/dynamic-tryon-page/.

In contrast, this paper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike the garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two input images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment worn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination of the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose Flattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that operates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the source image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3) integrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome the challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we introduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and quantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEMF-VTO: Point-Enhanced Video Virtual Try-on via Mask-free Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03021v5)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Virtual Try-on aims to seamlessly transfer a reference garment onto a target person in a video while preserving both visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Existing methods typically rely on inpainting masks to define the try-on area, enabling accurate garment transfer for simple scenes (e.g., in-shop videos). However, these mask-based approaches struggle with complex real-world scenarios, as overly large and inconsistent masks often destroy spatial-temporal information, leading to distorted results. Mask-free methods alleviate this issue but face challenges in accurately determining the try-on area, especially for videos with dynamic body movements. To address these limitations, we propose PEMF-VTO, a novel Point-Enhanced Mask-Free Video Virtual Try-On framework that leverages sparse point alignments to explicitly guide garment transfer. Our key innovation is the introduction of point-enhanced guidance, which provides flexible and reliable control over both spatial-level garment transfer and temporal-level video coherence. Specifically, we design a Point-Enhanced Transformer (PET) with two core components: Point-Enhanced Spatial Attention (PSA), which uses frame-cloth point alignments to precisely guide garment transfer, and Point-Enhanced Temporal Attention (PTA), which leverages frame-frame point correspondences to enhance temporal coherence and ensure smooth transitions across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PEMF-VTO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generating more natural, coherent, and visually appealing try-on videos, particularly for challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

A unified, training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference, ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene.

VTON generates images of a person in a specified garment using a target photo and a standardized garment image, while a more challenging variant, Person-to-Person Virtual Try-On (p2p-VTON), uses a photo of another person wearing the garment. VTOFF, in contrast, extracts standardized garment images from photos of clothed individuals. We introduce Multi-Garment TryOffDiff (MGT), a diffusion-based VTOFF model capable of handling diverse garment types, including upper-body, lower-body, and dresses. MGT builds on a latent diffusion architecture with SigLIP-based image conditioning to capture garment characteristics such as shape, texture, and pattern. To address garment diversity, MGT incorporates class-specific embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art VTOFF results on VITON-HD and competitive performance on DressCode. When paired with VTON models, it further enhances p2p-VTON by reducing unwanted attribute transfer, such as skin tone, ensuring preservation of person-specific characteristics.

A critical technical challenge in foundation VTO applications is the accurate synthesis of foundation-skin tone color blending while maintaining the scalability of the method across diverse product ranges. In this work, we propose a novel method to approximate well-established Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory for faster image synthesis while preserving foundation-skin tone color blending realism. Additionally, we build a scalable end-to-end framework for realistic foundation makeup VTO solely depending on the product information available on e-commerce sites. We validate our method using real-world makeup images, demonstrating that our framework outperforms other techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the workshop Three questions about virtual try-on at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

This paper addresses how to achieve multifunctional virtual try-on guided solely by text instructions, including full outfit change and local editing. Previous methods primarily relied on end-to-end networks to perform single try-on tasks, lacking versatility and flexibility. We propose TalkFashion, an intelligent try-on assistant that leverages the powerful comprehension capabilities of large language models to analyze user instructions and determine which task to execute, thereby activating different processing pipelines accordingly. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-based local repainting model that eliminates the need for users to manually provide masks. With the help of multi-modal models, this approach achieves fully automated local editings, enhancing the flexibility of editing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate better semantic consistency and visual quality compared to the current methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Another limitation is the absence of text-guided makeup try-on, which is more user-friendly without needing reference images. In this study, we make the first attempt to use a single model for various makeup tasks. Specifically, we formulate different makeup tasks as cross-domain translations and leverage a cross-domain diffusion model to accomplish all tasks. Unlike existing methods that rely on separate encoder-decoder configurations or cycle-based mechanisms, we propose using different domain embeddings to facilitate domain control. This allows for seamless domain switching by merely changing embeddings with a single model, thereby reducing the reliance on additional modules for different tasks. Moreover, to support precise text-to-makeup applications, we introduce the MT-Text dataset by extending the MT dataset with textual annotations, advancing the practicality of makeup technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPRW2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically fine-tune pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization, as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject fidelity and prompt consistency.</p></details> |  |

Concat-ID employs variational autoencoders to extract image features, which are then concatenated with video latents along the sequence dimension. It relies exclusively on inherent 3D self-attention mechanisms to incorporate them, eliminating the need for additional parameters or modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation. Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis, providing a versatile and scalable solution for a wide range of applications.</p></details> |  |

To improve customers' experience in online shopping, we propose a novel comprehensive KiseKloset system for outfit retrieval, recommendation, and try-on. We explore two approaches for outfit retrieval: similar item retrieval and text feedback-guided item retrieval. Notably, we introduce a novel transformer architecture designed to recommend complementary items from diverse categories. Furthermore, we enhance the overall performance of the search pipeline by integrating approximate algorithms to optimize the search process. Additionally, addressing the crucial needs of online shoppers, we employ a lightweight yet efficient virtual try-on framework capable of real-time operation, memory efficiency, and maintaining realistic outputs compared to its predecessors. This virtual try-on module empowers users to visualize specific garments on themselves, enhancing the customers' experience and reducing costs associated with damaged items for retailers. We deployed our end-to-end system for online users to test and provide feedback, enabling us to measure their satisfaction levels. The results of our user study revealed that 84% of participants found our comprehensive system highly useful, significantly improving their online shopping experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffFit: Disentangled Garment Warping and Texture Refinement for Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23295v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, with broad applications in e-commerce and digital fashion. While recent advances in latent diffusion models have substantially improved visual quality, existing approaches still struggle with preserving fine-grained garment details, achieving precise garment-body alignment, maintaining inference efficiency, and generalizing to diverse poses and clothing styles. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFit, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework for high-fidelity virtual try-on. DiffFit adopts a progressive generation strategy: the first stage performs geometry-aware garment warping, aligning the garment with the target body through fine-grained deformation and pose adaptation. The second stage refines texture fidelity via a cross-modal conditional diffusion model that integrates the warped garment, the original garment appearance, and the target person image for high-quality rendering. By decoupling geometric alignment and appearance refinement, DiffFit effectively reduces task complexity and enhances both generation stability and visual realism. It excels in preserving garment-specific attributes such as textures, wrinkles, and lighting, while ensuring accurate alignment with the human body. Extensive experiments on large-scale VTON benchmarks demonstrate that DiffFit achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and perceptual evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Virtual Try-on with Conditional Diffusion Transformer Inpainter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21270v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to naturally fit a garment to a target person in consecutive video frames. It is a challenging task, on the one hand, the output video should be in good spatial-temporal consistency, on the other hand, the details of the given garment need to be preserved well in all the frames. Naively using image-based try-on methods frame by frame can get poor results due to severe inconsistency. Recent diffusion-based video try-on methods, though very few, happen to coincide with a similar solution: inserting temporal attention into image-based try-on model to adapt it for video try-on task, which have shown improvements but there still exist inconsistency problems. In this paper, we propose ViTI (Video Try-on Inpainter), formulate and implement video virtual try-on as a conditional video inpainting task, which is different from previous methods. In this way, we start with a video generation problem instead of an image-based try-on problem, which from the beginning has a better spatial-temporal consistency. Specifically, at first we build a video inpainting framework based on Diffusion Transformer with full 3D spatial-temporal attention, and then we progressively adapt it for video garment inpainting, with a collection of masking strategies and multi-stage training. After these steps, the model can inpaint the masked garment area with appropriate garment pixels according to the prompt with good spatial-temporal consistency. Finally, as other try-on methods, garment condition is added to the model to make sure the inpainted garment appearance and details are as expected. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that ViTI is superior to previous works.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[InstructAttribute: Fine-grained Object Attributes editing with Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00751v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are widely used in image editing due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, achieving fine-grained control over specific object attributes, such as color and material, remains a considerable challenge. Existing methods often fail to accurately modify these attributes or compromise structural integrity and overall image consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Structure Preservation and Attribute Amplification (SPAA), a novel training-free framework that enables precise generation of color and material attributes for the same object by intelligently manipulating self-attention maps and cross-attention values within diffusion models. Building on SPAA, we integrate multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to automate data curation and instruction generation. Leveraging this object attribute data collection engine, we construct the Attribute Dataset, encompassing a comprehensive range of colors and materials across diverse object categories. Using this generated dataset, we propose InstructAttribute, an instruction-tuned model that enables fine-grained and object-level attribute editing through natural language prompts. This capability holds significant practical implications for diverse fields, from accelerating product design and e-commerce visualization to enhancing virtual try-on experiences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructAttribute outperforms existing instruction-based baselines, achieving a superior balance between attribute modification accuracy and structural preservation.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods have achieved notable progress, they still face significant challenges in maintaining consistency across different poses. Specifically, geometric distortions lead to a lack of spatial consistency, mismatches in garment structure and texture across poses result in semantic inconsistency, and the loss or distortion of fine-grained details diminishes visual fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose HF-VTON, a novel framework that ensures high-fidelity virtual try-on performance across diverse poses. HF-VTON consists of three key modules: (1) the Appearance-Preserving Warp Alignment Module (APWAM), which aligns garments to human poses, addressing geometric deformations and ensuring spatial consistency; (2) the Semantic Representation and Comprehension Module (SRCM), which captures fine-grained garment attributes and multi-pose data to enhance semantic representation, maintaining structural, textural, and pattern consistency; and (3) the Multimodal Prior-Guided Appearance Generation Module (MPAGM), which integrates multimodal features and prior knowledge from pre-trained models to optimize appearance generation, ensuring both semantic and geometric consistency. Additionally, to overcome data limitations in existing benchmarks, we introduce the SAMP-VTONS dataset, featuring multi-pose pairs and rich textual annotations for a more comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that HF-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both VITON-HD and SAMP-VTONS, excelling in visual fidelity, semantic consistency, and detail preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the publication of the paper, we discovered some significant errors/omissions that need to be corrected and improved</p></details> |

While per-garment virtual try-on methods have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1) the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronoTailor: Harnessing Attention Guidance for Fine-Grained Video Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05858v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly replace the clothing of a person in a source video with a target garment. Despite significant progress in this field, existing approaches still struggle to maintain continuity and reproduce garment details. In this paper, we introduce ChronoTailor, a diffusion-based framework that generates temporally consistent videos while preserving fine-grained garment details. By employing a precise spatio-temporal attention mechanism to guide the integration of fine-grained garment features, ChronoTailor achieves robust try-on performance. First, ChronoTailor leverages region-aware spatial guidance to steer the evolution of spatial attention and employs an attention-driven temporal feature fusion mechanism to generate more continuous temporal features. This dual approach not only enables fine-grained local editing but also effectively mitigates artifacts arising from video dynamics. Second, ChronoTailor integrates multi-scale garment features to preserve low-level visual details and incorporates a garment-pose feature alignment to ensure temporal continuity during dynamic motion. Additionally, we collect StyleDress, a new dataset featuring intricate garments, varied environments, and diverse poses, offering advantages over existing public datasets, and will be publicly available for research. Extensive experiments show that ChronoTailor maintains spatio-temporal continuity and preserves garment details during motion, significantly outperforming previous methods.</p></details> |  |

Although video generation is widely applied in various fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement, object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

The IVTON task involves seamlessly superimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another, creating a realistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike conventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large pre-trained U-Net architectures, ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight, scalable transformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme, achieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key component of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA), a dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image encoder into a unified feature of the same size, guided by diffusion timestep and garment image complexity. This enables adaptive weighting of features, allowing the model to emphasize either global information or fine-grained details based on the requirements of the denoising stage. Additionally, the Salient Region Extractor (SRE) module is presented to identify complex region of the garment to provide high-resolution local information to the denoising model as an additional condition alongside the global information of the full garment image. This targeted conditioning strategy enhances detail preservation of fine details in highly salient garment regions, optimizing computational resources by avoiding unnecessarily processing entire garment image. Comparative evaluations confirms that ITA-MDT improves efficiency while maintaining strong performance, reaching state-of-the-art results in several metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://jiwoohong93.github.io/ita-mdt/</p></details> |

Using advanced diffusion models, DiffusionTrend harnesses latent information rich in prior information to capture the nuances of garment details. Throughout the diffusion denoising process, these details are seamlessly integrated into the model image generation, expertly directed by a precise garment mask crafted by a lightweight and compact CNN. Although our DiffusionTrend model initially demonstrates suboptimal metric performance, our exploratory approach offers some important advantages: (1) It circumvents resource-intensive retraining of diffusion models on large datasets. (2) It eliminates the necessity for various complex and user-unfriendly model inputs. (3) It delivers a visually compelling try-on experience, underscoring the potential of training-free diffusion model. This initial foray into the application of untrained diffusion models in virtual try-on technology potentially paves the way for further exploration and refinement in this industrially and academically valuable field.</p></details> |  |

To generate high-quality try-on results, accurately warping the clothing item to fit the human body plays a significant role, as slight misalignment may lead to unrealistic artifacts in the fitting image. Most existing methods warp the clothing by feature matching and thin-plate spline (TPS). However, it often fails to preserve clothing details due to self-occlusion, severe misalignment between poses, etc. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a detail retention virtual try-on method via accurate non-rigid registration (VITON-DRR) for diverse human poses. Specifically, we reconstruct a human semantic segmentation using a dual-pyramid-structured feature extractor. Then, a novel Deformation Module is designed for extracting the cloth key points and warping them through an accurate non-rigid registration algorithm. Finally, the Image Synthesis Module is designed to synthesize the deformed garment image and generate the human pose information adaptively. {Compared with} traditional methods, the proposed VITON-DRR can make the deformation of fitting images more accurate and retain more garment details. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, Accepted by Computers & Graphics</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily focus on either facial synthesis or near-frontal body generation, with limited ability to simultaneously control key factors such as viewpoint, pose, clothing, and identity in a disentangled manner. In this paper, we introduce a new disentangled and controllable human synthesis task, which explicitly separates and manipulates these four factors within a unified framework. We first develop an end-to-end generative model trained on MVHumanNet for factor disentanglement. However, the domain gap between MVHumanNet and in-the-wild data produces unsatisfactory results, motivating the exploration of virtual try-on (VTON) dataset as a potential solution. Through experiments, we observe that simply incorporating the VTON dataset as additional data to train the end-to-end model degrades performance, primarily due to the inconsistency in data forms between the two datasets, which disrupts the disentanglement process. To better leverage both datasets, we propose a stage-by-stage framework that decomposes human image generation into three sequential steps: clothed A-pose generation, back-view synthesis, and pose and view control. This structured pipeline enables better dataset utilization at different stages, significantly improving controllability and generalization, especially for in-the-wild scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our stage-by-stage approach outperforms end-to-end models in both visual fidelity and disentanglement quality, offering a scalable solution for real-world tasks.

The difficulty lies in preserving the appearance details of the reference object and accurately modeling coherent motions at the same time. In this paper, we propose VideoAnydoor, a zero-shot video object insertion framework with high-fidelity detail preservation and precise motion control. Starting from a text-to-video model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos and static images with a weighted loss to enhance insertion quality. VideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing methods and naturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking head generation, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without task-specific fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH2025 Project page: https://videoanydoor.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Virtual Try-On: Generating Multi-Category Product-Style Images from Clothed Individuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21062v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF), which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i) difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses, often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the target garments.</p></details> |  |

A comprehensive benchmark is essential for three key reasons:(1) Current metrics inadequately reflect human perception, particularly in unpaired try-on settings;(2)Most existing test sets are limited to indoor scenarios, lacking complexity for real-world evaluation; and (3) An ideal system should guide future advancements in virtual try-on generation. To address these needs, we introduce VTBench, a hierarchical benchmark suite that systematically decomposes virtual image try-on into hierarchical, disentangled dimensions, each equipped with tailored test sets and evaluation criteria. VTBench exhibits three key advantages:1) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework: The benchmark encompasses five critical dimensions for virtual try-on generation (e.g., overall image quality, texture preservation, complex background consistency, cross-category size adaptability, and hand-occlusion handling). Granular evaluation metrics of corresponding test sets pinpoint model capabilities and limitations across diverse, challenging scenarios.2) Human Alignment: Human preference annotations are provided for each test set, ensuring the benchmark's alignment with perceptual quality across all evaluation dimensions. (3) Valuable Insights: Beyond standard indoor settings, we analyze model performance variations across dimensions and investigate the disparity between indoor and real-world try-on scenarios. To foster the field of virtual try-on towards challenging real-world scenario, VTBench will be open-sourced, including all test sets, evaluation protocols, generated results, and human annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Websit: \url{https://github.com/HUuxiaobin/VTBench}</p></details> |
| **[Pursuing Temporal-Consistent Video Virtual Try-On via Dynamic Pose Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16980v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video virtual try-on aims to seamlessly dress a subject in a video with a specific garment. The primary challenge involves preserving the visual authenticity of the garment while dynamically adapting to the pose and physique of the subject. While existing methods have predominantly focused on image-based virtual try-on, extending these techniques directly to videos often results in temporal inconsistencies. Most current video virtual try-on approaches alleviate this challenge by incorporating temporal modules, yet still overlook the critical spatiotemporal pose interactions between human and garment. Effective pose interactions in videos should not only consider spatial alignment between human and garment poses in each frame but also account for the temporal dynamics of human poses throughout the entire video. With such motivation, we propose a new framework, namely Dynamic Pose Interaction Diffusion Models (DPIDM), to leverage diffusion models to delve into dynamic pose interactions for video virtual try-on. Technically, DPIDM introduces a skeleton-based pose adapter to integrate synchronized human and garment poses into the denoising network. A hierarchical attention module is then exquisitely designed to model intra-frame human-garment pose interactions and long-term human pose dynamics across frames through pose-aware spatial and temporal attention mechanisms. Moreover, DPIDM capitalizes on a temporal regularized attention loss between consecutive frames to enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on VITON-HD, VVT and ViViD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DPIDM against the baseline methods. Notably, DPIDM achieves VFID score of 0.506 on VVT dataset, leading to 60.5% improvement over the state-of-the-art GPD-VVTO approach.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Incorporating Visual Correspondence into Diffusion Model for Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16977v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown preliminary success in virtual try-on (VTON) task. The typical dual-branch architecture comprises two UNets for implicit garment deformation and synthesized image generation respectively, and has emerged as the recipe for VTON task. Nevertheless, the problem remains challenging to preserve the shape and every detail of the given garment due to the intrinsic stochasticity of diffusion model. To alleviate this issue, we novelly propose to explicitly capitalize on visual correspondence as the prior to tame diffusion process instead of simply feeding the whole garment into UNet as the appearance reference. Specifically, we interpret the fine-grained appearance and texture details as a set of structured semantic points, and match the semantic points rooted in garment to the ones over target person through local flow warping. Such 2D points are then augmented into 3D-aware cues with depth/normal map of target person. The correspondence mimics the way of putting clothing on human body and the 3D-aware cues act as semantic point matching to supervise diffusion model training. A point-focused diffusion loss is further devised to fully take the advantage of semantic point matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong garment detail preservation of our approach, evidenced by state-of-the-art VTON performances on both VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.

However, the generated models are often fused into a single piece, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. This paper focuses on 3D garment generation, a key area for applications like virtual try-on with dynamic garment animations, which require garments to be separable and simulation-ready. We introduce Dress-1-to-3, a novel pipeline that reconstructs physics-plausible, simulation-ready separated garments with sewing patterns and humans from an in-the-wild image. Starting with the image, our approach combines a pre-trained image-to-sewing pattern generation model for creating coarse sewing patterns with a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model to produce multi-view images. The sewing pattern is further refined using a differentiable garment simulator based on the generated multi-view images. Versatile experiments demonstrate that our optimization approach substantially enhances the geometric alignment of the reconstructed 3D garments and humans with the input image. Furthermore, by integrating a texture generation module and a human motion generation module, we produce customized physics-plausible and realistic dynamic garment demonstrations.

| **[SiCo: An Interactive Size-Controllable Virtual Try-On Approach for Informed Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02803v2)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTO) applications aim to replicate the in-store shopping experience and enhance online shopping by enabling users to interact with garments. However, many existing tools adopt a one-size-fits-all approach when visualizing clothing items. This approach limits user interaction with garments, particularly regarding size and fit adjustments, and fails to provide direct insights for size recommendations. As a result, these limitations contribute to high return rates in online shopping. To address this, we introduce SiCo, a new online VTO system that allows users to upload images of themselves and interact with garments by visualizing how different sizes would fit their bodies. Our user study demonstrates that our approach significantly improves users' ability to assess how outfits will appear on their bodies and increases their confidence in selecting clothing sizes that align with their preferences. Based on our evaluation, we believe that SiCo has the potential to reduce return rates and transform the online clothing shopping experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single View Garment Reconstruction Using Diffusion Mapping Via Pattern Coordinates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08353v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images is fundamental to applications like virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. While recent advances have enhanced human body recovery, accurate reconstruction of garment geometry -- especially for loose-fitting clothing -- remains an open challenge. We present a novel method for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from single images that bridges 2D and 3D representations. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment shape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain physical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling downstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2025 |
| **[Enhancing Virtual Try-On with Synthetic Pairs and Error-Aware Noise Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04666v3)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an isolated garment image in a canonical product view and a separate image of a person, the virtual try-on task aims to generate a new image of the person wearing the target garment. Prior virtual try-on works face two major challenges in achieving this goal: a) the paired (human, garment) training data has limited availability; b) generating textures on the human that perfectly match that of the prompted garment is difficult, often resulting in distorted text and faded textures. Our work explores ways to tackle these issues through both synthetic data as well as model refinement. We introduce a garment extraction model that generates (human, synthetic garment) pairs from a single image of a clothed individual. The synthetic pairs can then be used to augment the training of virtual try-on. We also propose an Error-Aware Refinement-based Schr\"odinger Bridge (EARSB) that surgically targets localized generation errors for correcting the output of a base virtual try-on model. To identify likely errors, we propose a weakly-supervised error classifier that localizes regions for refinement, subsequently augmenting the Schr\"odinger Bridge's noise schedule with its confidence heatmap. Experiments on VITON-HD and DressCode-Upper demonstrate that our synthetic data augmentation enhances the performance of prior work, while EARSB improves the overall image quality. In user studies, our model is preferred by the users in an average of 59% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Creating Your Editable 3D Photorealistic Avatar with Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20403v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized 3D avatar editing holds significant promise due to its user-friendliness and availability to applications such as AR/VR and virtual try-ons. Previous studies have explored the feasibility of 3D editing, but often struggle to generate visually pleasing results, possibly due to the unstable representation learning under mixed optimization of geometry and texture in complicated reconstructed scenarios. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle to generate high-quality and temporally consistent results when handling complex clothing patterns and diverse body poses. We present 3DV-TON, a novel diffusion-based framework for generating high-fidelity and temporally consistent video try-on results. Our approach employs generated animatable textured 3D meshes as explicit frame-level guidance, alleviating the issue of models over-focusing on appearance fidelity at the expanse of motion coherence. This is achieved by enabling direct reference to consistent garment texture movements throughout video sequences. The proposed method features an adaptive pipeline for generating dynamic 3D guidance: (1) selecting a keyframe for initial 2D image try-on, followed by (2) reconstructing and animating a textured 3D mesh synchronized with original video poses. We further introduce a robust rectangular masking strategy that successfully mitigates artifact propagation caused by leaking clothing information during dynamic human and garment movements. To advance video try-on research, we introduce HR-VVT, a high-resolution benchmark dataset containing 130 videos with diverse clothing types and scenarios. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate our superior performance over existing methods.

With the advent of vision-language models (VLM), new opportunities have emerged to enhance retailing through natural language and visual interactions. This work proposes FashionM3, a multimodal, multitask, and multiround fashion assistant, built upon a VLM fine-tuned for fashion-specific tasks. It helps users discover satisfying outfits by offering multiple capabilities including personalized recommendation, alternative suggestion, product image generation, and virtual try-on simulation. Fine-tuned on the novel FashionRec dataset, comprising 331,124 multimodal dialogue samples across basic, personalized, and alternative recommendation tasks, FashionM3 delivers contextually personalized suggestions with iterative refinement through multiround interactions.

| **[Shape-Guided Clothing Warping for Virtual Try-On](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15232v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based virtual try-on aims to seamlessly fit in-shop clothing to a person image while maintaining pose consistency. Existing methods commonly employ the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform in-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising performance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details, leading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as well as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed SCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb textures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and try-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we devise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow path. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's body, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and post-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance flow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results, we integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network based on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are able to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and precise control over details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Instead of training separate models for individual tasks, our approach is trained once on our new AnyInsertion dataset--comprising 120K prompt-image pairs covering diverse tasks such as person, object, and garment insertion--and effortlessly generalizes to a wide range of insertion scenarios. Such a challenging setting requires capturing both identity features and fine-grained details, while allowing versatile local adaptations in style, color, and texture. To this end, we propose to leverage the multimodal attention of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to support both mask- and text-guided editing. Furthermore, we introduce an in-context editing mechanism that treats the reference image as contextual information, employing two prompting strategies to harmonize the inserted elements with the target scene while faithfully preserving their distinctive features. Extensive experiments on AnyInsertion, DreamBooth, and VTON-HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing alternatives, underscoring its great potential in real-world applications such as creative content generation, virtual try-on, and scene composition.</p></details> |  |

By framing the task as grid-based image completion and simply replicating the subject image(s) in a mosaic layout, we activate strong identity-preserving capabilities without any additional data, training, or inference-time fine-tuning. This "free lunch" approach is further strengthened by a novel cascade attention design and meta prompting technique, boosting fidelity and versatility. Experimental results show that our method outperforms baselines across multiple key metrics in benchmarks and human preference studies, with trade-offs in certain aspects. Additionally, it supports diverse edits, including logo insertion, virtual try-on, and subject replacement or insertion. These results demonstrate that a pre-trained foundational text-to-image model can enable high-quality, resource-efficient subject-driven generation, opening new possibilities for lightweight customization in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fashion-RAG: Multimodal Fashion Image Editing via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14011v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the fashion industry has increasingly adopted AI technologies to enhance customer experience, driven by the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and virtual applications. Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.</p></details> | IJCNN 2025 |

Current methods, often using Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically focus on query formulation or reasoning over results, without explicitly encouraging persistence after a failed search. We introduce ReZero (Retry-Zero), a novel RL framework that directly rewards the act of retrying a search query following an initial unsuccessful attempt. This incentivizes the LLM to explore alternative queries rather than prematurely halting. ReZero demonstrates significant improvement, achieving 46.88% accuracy compared to a 25% baseline. By rewarding persistence, ReZero enhances LLM robustness in complex information-seeking scenarios where initial queries may prove insufficient.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose VTON 360, a novel 3D VTON method that addresses the open challenge of achieving high-fidelity VTON that supports any-view rendering. Specifically, we leverage the equivalence between a 3D model and its rendered multi-view 2D images, and reformulate 3D VTON as an extension of 2D VTON that ensures 3D consistent results across multiple views. To achieve this, we extend 2D VTON models to include multi-view garments and clothing-agnostic human body images as input, and propose several novel techniques to enhance them, including: i) a pseudo-3D pose representation using normal maps derived from the SMPL-X 3D human model, ii) a multi-view spatial attention mechanism that models the correlations between features from different viewing angles, and iii) a multi-view CLIP embedding that enhances the garment CLIP features used in 2D VTON with camera information. Extensive experiments on large-scale real datasets and clothing images from e-commerce platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Existing methods often fail to reproduce the fine details of target garments effectively and lack generalizability to new scenarios. In the proposed method, the person's initial garment is completely removed. Subsequently, a precise warping is performed using the predicted keypoints to fully align the target garment with the body structure and pose of the individual. Based on the warped garment, a body segmentation map is more accurately predicted. Then, using an alignment-aware segment normalization, the misaligned areas between the warped garment and the predicted garment region in the segmentation map are removed. Finally, the generator produces the final image with high visual quality, reconstructing the precise characteristics of the target garment, including its overall shape and texture. This approach emphasizes preserving garment characteristics and improving adaptability to various poses, providing better generalization for diverse applications.</p></details> | in Persian language |

Diffusion-based virtual try-on systems aim to naturally align garments with target individuals, generating realistic and detailed try-on images. However, existing methods overlook the importance of garment size variations in meeting personalized consumer needs. To address this, we propose a novel virtual try-on method named SV-VTON, which introduces garment sizing concepts into virtual try-on tasks. The SV-VTON method first generates refined masks for multiple garment sizes, then integrates these masks with garment images at varying proportions, enabling virtual try-on simulations across different sizes. In addition, we developed a specialized size evaluation module to quantitatively assess the accuracy of size variations. This module calculates differences between generated size increments and international sizing standards, providing objective measurements of size accuracy. To further validate SV-VTON's generalization capability across different models, we conducted experiments on multiple SOTA Diffusion models. The results demonstrate that SV-VTON consistently achieves precise multi-size virtual try-on across various SOTA models, and validates the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method, significantly fulfilling users' personalized multi-size virtual try-on requirements.</p></details> |  |

Here, the main bottleneck is data acquisition for training: collecting a large-scale dataset of high-quality reference garment images per human subject is quite challenging, i.e., ideally, one needs to manually gather every single garment photograph worn by each human. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline to construct a large synthetic dataset, consisting of human and multiple-garment pairs, by introducing a model to extract any reference garment images from each human image. To ensure data quality, we also propose a filtering strategy to remove undesirable generated data based on measuring perceptual similarities between the garment presented in human image and extracted garment. Finally, by utilizing the constructed synthetic dataset, we train a diffusion model having two parallel denoising paths that use multiple garment images as conditions to generate human images while preserving their fine-grained details. We further show the wide-applicability of our framework by adapting it to different types of reference-based generation in the fashion domain, including virtual try-on, and controllable human image generation with other conditions, e.g., pose, face, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

However, the scarcity of paired garment-model data makes it challenging for existing methods to achieve high generalization and quality in VTON. Also, it limits the ability to generate mask-free try-ons. To tackle the data scarcity problem, approaches such as Stable Garment and MMTryon use a synthetic data strategy, effectively increasing the amount of paired data on the model side. However, existing methods are typically limited to performing specific try-on tasks and lack user-friendliness. To enhance the generalization and controllability of VTON generation, we propose Any2AnyTryon, which can generate try-on results based on different textual instructions and model garment images to meet various needs, eliminating the reliance on masks, poses, or other conditions. Specifically, we first construct the virtual try-on dataset LAION-Garment, the largest known open-source garment try-on dataset. Then, we introduce adaptive position embedding, which enables the model to generate satisfactory outfitted model images or garment images based on input images of different sizes and categories, significantly enhancing the generalization and controllability of VTON generation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Any2AnyTryon and compare it with existing methods. The results show that Any2AnyTryon enables flexible, controllable, and high-quality image-based virtual try-on generation. https://logn-2024.github.io/Any2anyTryonProjectPage</p></details> | 13 pages,13 figures |

Due to the intricate tiny patterns and repeated geometric sub-structures in most ornaments, it is much more difficult to guarantee identity and appearance consistency under large pose and scale variances between ornaments and models. This paper proposes the task of virtual try-on for ornaments and presents a method to improve the geometric and appearance preservation of ornament virtual try-ons. Specifically, we estimate an accurate wearing mask to improve the alignments between ornaments and models in an iterative scheme alongside the denoising process. To preserve structure details, we further regularize attention layers to map the reference ornament mask to the wearing mask in an implicit way. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully wears ornaments from reference images onto target models, handling substantial differences in scale and pose while preserving identity and achieving realistic visual effects.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods adopt a single global deformation to perform clothing warping directly, which lacks fine-grained modeling of in-shop clothing and leads to distorted clothing appearance. In addition, existing methods usually fail to generate limb details well because they are limited by the used clothing-agnostic person representation without referring to the limb textures of the person image. To address these problems, we propose Limb-aware Virtual Try-on Network named PL-VTON, which performs fine-grained clothing warping progressively and generates high-quality try-on results with realistic limb details. Specifically, we present Progressive Clothing Warping (PCW) that explicitly models the location and size of in-shop clothing and utilizes a two-stage alignment strategy to progressively align the in-shop clothing with the human body. Moreover, a novel gravity-aware loss that considers the fit of the person wearing clothing is adopted to better handle the clothing edges. Then, we design Person Parsing Estimator (PPE) with a non-limb target parsing map to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and body regions. Finally, we introduce Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) that focuses on generating realistic details in limb regions, where a coarse try-on result is first generated by fusing the warped clothing image with the person image, then limb textures are further fused with the coarse result under limb-aware guidance to refine limb details.

In addition, these methods usually mask the limb textures of the input for the clothing-agnostic person representation, which results in inaccurate predictions for human limb regions (i.e., the exposed arm skin), especially when transforming between long-sleeved and short-sleeved garments. To address these problems, we present a progressive virtual try-on framework, named PL-VTON, which performs pixel-level clothing warping based on multiple attributes of clothing and embeds explicit limb-aware features to generate photo-realistic try-on results. Specifically, we design a Multi-attribute Clothing Warping (MCW) module that adopts a two-stage alignment strategy based on multiple attributes to progressively estimate pixel-level clothing displacements. A Human Parsing Estimator (HPE) is then introduced to semantically divide the person into various regions, which provides structural constraints on the human body and therefore alleviates texture bleeding between clothing and limb regions. Finally, we propose a Limb-aware Texture Fusion (LTF) module to estimate high-quality details in limb regions by fusing textures of the clothing and the human body with the guidance of explicit limb-aware features.

Numerous approaches use replicated backbones or additional image encoders to extract garment features, leading to higher computational cost and a more complex network structure. In this work, we introduce ITVTON, which utilizes the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) as a generator to enhance image quality. ITVTON also improves garment-person interaction by stitching garment and person images along the spatial channel, and integrates textual descriptions from both the garment and person images to further enhance the realism of the generated visuals. This network structure is efficient, and to further reduce computational cost, we constrain training to attention parameters within a single Diffusion Transformer (Single-DiT) block.

However, the T2I models that underpin these methods have become outdated, thereby limiting the potential for further improvement in VTO. Additionally, current methods face notable challenges in accurately rendering text on garments without distortion and preserving fine-grained details, such as textures and material fidelity. The emergence of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based T2I models has showcased impressive performance and offers a promising opportunity for advancing VTO. Directly applying existing VTO techniques to transformer-based T2I models is ineffective due to substantial architectural differences, which hinder their ability to fully leverage the models' advanced capabilities for improved text generation. To address these challenges and unlock the full potential of DiT-based T2I models for VTO, we propose TED-VITON, a novel framework that integrates a Garment Semantic (GS) Adapter for enhancing garment-specific features, a Text Preservation Loss to ensure accurate and distortion-free text rendering, and a constraint mechanism to generate prompts by optimizing Large Language Model (LLM). These innovations enable state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in visual quality and text fidelity, establishing a new benchmark for VTO task.

However, existing methods often rely on user-provided masks, introducing complexity and performance degradation due to imperfect inputs, as shown in Fig.1(a). To address this, we propose a Mask-Free VITON (MF-VITON) framework that achieves realistic VITON using only a single person image and a target garment, eliminating the requirement for auxiliary masks. Our approach introduces a novel two-stage pipeline: (1) We leverage existing Mask-based VITON models to synthesize a high-quality dataset. This dataset contains diverse, realistic pairs of person images and corresponding garments, augmented with varied backgrounds to mimic real-world scenarios. (2) The pre-trained Mask-based model is fine-tuned on the generated dataset, enabling garment transfer without mask dependencies. This stage simplifies the input requirements while preserving garment texture and shape fidelity.

Despite notable progress in single-image virtual try-on (VTO), current methodologies often struggle to preserve a consistent and authentic appearance of clothing across extended video sequences. This challenge arises from the complexities of capturing dynamic human pose and maintaining target clothing characteristics. We leverage pre-existing video foundation models to introduce RealVVT, a photoRealistic Video Virtual Try-on framework tailored to bolster stability and realism within dynamic video contexts. Our methodology encompasses a Clothing & Temporal Consistency strategy, an Agnostic-guided Attention Focus Loss mechanism to ensure spatial consistency, and a Pose-guided Long Video VTO technique adept at handling extended video sequences.Extensive experiments across various datasets confirms that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both single-image and video VTO tasks, offering a viable solution for practical applications within the realms of fashion e-commerce and virtual fitting environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (8 pages main text, 2 pages references), 5 figures in the main text, and 4 pages supplementary materials with 3 additional figures</p></details> |

The primary difficulty arises from the absence of human-like reasoning, which involves addressing size mismatches between garments and models while recognizing and leveraging the distinct functionalities of various regions within the model images. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from human cognitive processes and disentangle the complex reasoning required for cross-category try-on into a structured framework. This framework systematically decomposes the model image into three distinct regions: try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones. Each zone plays a specific role in accommodating the garment and facilitating realistic synthesis. To endow the model with robust reasoning capabilities for cross-category scenarios, we propose an iterative data constructor. This constructor encompasses diverse scenarios, including intra-category try-on, any-to-dress transformations (replacing any garment category with a dress), and dress-to-any transformations (replacing a dress with another garment category). Utilizing the generated dataset, we introduce a tri-zone priors generator that intelligently predicts the try-on, reconstruction, and imagination zones by analyzing how the input garment is expected to align with the model image. Guided by these tri-zone priors, our proposed method, CrossVTON, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, it demonstrates superior capability in handling cross-category virtual try-on, meeting the complex demands of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CatVTON: Concatenation Is All You Need for Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15886v2)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic effects but often require additional encoding modules, a large number of training parameters, and complex preprocessing, which increases the burden on training and inference. In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules and analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in the inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn garments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them along spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of CatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON consists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant image and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M parameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we identify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only 49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates unnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and captioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the virtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild scenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, obtaining a standard garment is often more challenging than using the garment already worn by the person. To improve ease of use, we propose MFP-VTON, a Mask-Free framework for Person-to-Person VTON. Recognizing the scarcity of person-to-person data, we adapt a garment-to-person model and dataset to construct a specialized dataset for this task. Our approach builds upon a pretrained diffusion transformer, leveraging its strong generative capabilities. During mask-free model fine-tuning, we introduce a Focus Attention loss to emphasize the garment of the reference person and the details outside the garment of the target person. Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in both person-to-person and garment-to-person VTON tasks, generating high-fidelity fitting images.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present IPVTON, a novel image-based 3D virtual try-on framework. IPVTON employs score distillation sampling with image prompts to optimize a hybrid 3D human representation, integrating target garment features into diffusion priors through an image prompt adapter. To avoid interference with non-target areas, we leverage mask-guided image prompt embeddings to focus the image features on the try-on regions. Moreover, we impose geometric constraints on the 3D model with a pseudo silhouette generated by ControlNet, ensuring that the clothed 3D human model retains the shape of the source identity while accurately wearing the target garments. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that IPVTON outperforms previous methods in image-based 3D virtual try-on tasks, excelling in both geometry and texture.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often struggle with cultural bias, limited scalability, and alignment between textual prompts and generated visuals, particularly under weak supervision. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to address these challenges. Our method leverages LLMs for semantic refinement of textual prompts and introduces a weak supervision filtering module to effectively utilize noisy or weakly labeled data. By fine-tuning the LDM on an enhanced DeepFashion+ dataset enriched with global fashion styles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and higher Inception Scores (IS), while human evaluations confirm its ability to generate culturally diverse and semantically relevant fashion content. These results highlight the potential of LLM-guided diffusion models in driving scalable and inclusive AI-driven fashion innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientVITON: An Efficient Virtual Try-On Model using Optimized Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11776v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Would not it be much more convenient for everybody to try on clothes by only looking into a mirror ? The answer to that problem is virtual try-on, enabling users to digitally experiment with outfits. The core challenge lies in realistic image-to-image translation, where clothing must fit diverse human forms, poses, and figures. Early methods, which used 2D transformations, offered speed, but image quality was often disappointing and lacked the nuance of deep learning. Though GAN-based techniques enhanced realism, their dependence on paired data proved limiting. More adaptable methods offered great visuals but demanded significant computing power and time. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise for high-fidelity translation, yet the current crop of virtual try-on tools still struggle with detail loss and warping issues. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes EfficientVITON, a new virtual try-on system leveraging the impressive pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for better images and deployment feasibility. The system includes a spatial encoder to maintain clothings finer details and zero cross-attention blocks to capture the subtleties of how clothes fit a human body. Input images are carefully prepared, and the diffusion process has been tweaked to significantly cut generation time without image quality loss. The training process involves two distinct stages of fine-tuning, carefully incorporating a balance of loss functions to ensure both accurate try-on results and high-quality visuals. Rigorous testing on the VITON-HD dataset, supplemented with real-world examples, has demonstrated that EfficientVITON achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Another area of research focuses on the insertion and harmonization of objects within images. In this study, we explore the potential of using harmonization data in conjunction with a segmentation model to enhance the detection of edited image regions. These edits can be either manually crafted or generated using deep learning methods. Our findings demonstrate that this approach can effectively identify such edits. Existing forensic models often overlook the detection of harmonized objects in relation to the background, but our proposed Disharmony Network addresses this gap. By utilizing an aggregated dataset of harmonization techniques, our model outperforms existing forensic networks in identifying harmonized objects integrated into their backgrounds, and shows potential for detecting various forms of edits, including virtual try-on tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional VTON methods, often using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models, face challenges in achieving high realism and handling dynamic poses. This paper introduces Outfitting Diffusion with Pose Guided Condition (ODPG), a novel approach that leverages a latent diffusion model with multiple conditioning inputs during the denoising process. By transforming garment, pose, and appearance images into latent features and integrating these features in a UNet-based denoising model, ODPG achieves non-explicit synthesis of garments on dynamically posed human images. Our experiments on the FashionTryOn and a subset of the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate that ODPG generates realistic VTON images with fine-grained texture details across various poses, utilizing an end-to-end architecture without the need for explicit garment warping processes. Future work will focus on generating VTON outputs in video format and on applying our attention mechanism, as detailed in the Method section, to other domains with limited data.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

They use an extra reference network or an additional image encoder to process multiple conditional image inputs, which adds complexity pre-processing and additional computational costs. Besides, they require more than 25 inference steps, bringing longer inference time. In this work, with the development of diffusion transformer (DiT), we rethink the necessity of additional reference network or image encoder and introduce MC-VTON, which leverages DiT's intrinsic backbone to seamlessly integrate minimal conditional try-on inputs. Compared to existing methods, the superiority of MC-VTON is demonstrated in four aspects: (1) Superior detail fidelity. Our DiT-based MC-VTON exhibits superior fidelity in preserving fine-grained details. (2) Simplified network and inputs. We remove any extra reference network or image encoder. We also remove unnecessary conditions like the long prompt, pose estimation, human parsing, and depth map. We require only the masked person image and the garment image. (3) Parameter-efficient training. To process the try-on task, we fine-tune the FLUX.1-dev with only 39.7M additional parameters (0.33% of the backbone parameters). (4) Less inference steps. We apply distillation diffusion on MC-VTON and only need 8 steps to generate a realistic try-on image, with only 86.8M additional parameters (0.72% of the backbone parameters). Experiments show that MC-VTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results with fewer condition inputs, trainable parameters, and inference steps than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Early VTON methods relied on single generative networks, but challenges remain in preserving fine-grained garment details due to limitations in feature extraction and fusion. To address these issues, recent approaches have adopted a dual-network paradigm, incorporating a complementary "ReferenceNet" to enhance garment feature extraction and fusion. While effective, this dual-network approach introduces significant computational overhead, limiting its scalability for high-resolution and long-duration image/video VTON applications. In this paper, we challenge the dual-network paradigm by proposing a novel single-network VTON method that overcomes the limitations of existing techniques. Our method, namely MNVTON, introduces a Modality-specific Normalization strategy that separately processes text, image and video inputs, enabling them to share the same attention layers in a VTON network. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently achieves higher-quality, more detailed results for both image and video VTON tasks. Our results suggest that the single-network paradigm can rival the performance of dualnetwork approaches, offering a more efficient alternative for high-quality, scalable VTON applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ningshuliang.github.io/2023/Arxiv/index.html</p></details> |

Existing image-based methods fall into two categories: those that directly warp garment-images onto person-images (explicit warping), and those using cross-attention to reconstruct given garments (implicit warping). Explicit warping preserves garment details but often produces unrealistic output, while implicit warping achieves natural reconstruction but struggles with fine details. We propose HYB-VITON, a novel approach that combines the advantages of each method and includes both a preprocessing pipeline for warped garments and a novel training option. These components allow us to utilize beneficial regions of explicitly warped garments while leveraging the natural reconstruction of implicit warping.

However, existing methods solely focus on the frontal try-on using the frontal clothing. When the views of the clothing and person are significantly inconsistent, particularly when the person's view is non-frontal, the results are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, we introduce Multi-View Virtual Try-ON (MV-VTON), which aims to reconstruct the dressing results from multiple views using the given clothes. Given that single-view clothes provide insufficient information for MV-VTON, we instead employ two images, i.e., the frontal and back views of the clothing, to encompass the complete view as much as possible. Moreover, we adopt diffusion models that have demonstrated superior abilities to perform our MV-VTON. In particular, we propose a view-adaptive selection method where hard-selection and soft-selection are applied to the global and local clothing feature extraction, respectively. This ensures that the clothing features are roughly fit to the person's view. Subsequently, we suggest joint attention blocks to align and fuse clothing features with person features. Additionally, we collect a MV-VTON dataset MVG, in which each person has multiple photos with diverse views and poses. Experiments show that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art results on MV-VTON task using our MVG dataset, but also has superiority on frontal-view virtual try-on task using VITON-HD and DressCode datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by AAAI 2025.

To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results. However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently. To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions. Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Arxiv...</summary><p>Arxiv version of ICCV 2025 paper (3rd version)</p></details> |

Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii) introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split, our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end learnable camera pipelines.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[DiffPCN: Latent Diffusion Model Based on Multi-view Depth Images for Point Cloud Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23723v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then, since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.</p></details> |  |

While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation.

| **[FS-Diff: Semantic guidance and clarity-aware simultaneous multimodal image fusion and super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09427v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions, the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted, with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images. Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics in the fused images.

Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference, these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image." Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level vision tasks.

Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition. Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and robustness.

| **[A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01071v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Image Restoration and Enhancement: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09388v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration (IR) has been an indispensable and challenging task in the low-level vision field, which strives to improve the subjective quality of images distorted by various forms of degradation. Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV |

Experiments on Derain/Deshadow/Deblur task demonstrate that these methods are effective in improving restoration performance. In addition, this paper's model obtains significant PSNR, SSIM gain on three datasets with different degradation types, which is a strong proof that the recovered images are perceptually realistic.

Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently, building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and optimal usage conditions of DSConv.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The content of the paper is not yet fully developed, and the proposed approach requires further optimization.

| **[Refine-IQA: Multi-Stage Reinforcement Finetuning for Perceptual Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03763v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust "think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShadowMamba: State-Space Model with Boundary-Region Selective Scan for Shadow Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03260v4)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image shadow removal is a typical low-level vision task. Shadows cause local brightness shifts, which reduce the performance of downstream vision tasks. Currently, Transformer-based shadow removal methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism. To improve efficiency, many approaches use local attention, but this limits the ability to model global information and weakens the perception of brightness changes between regions. Recently, Mamba has shown strong performance in vision tasks by enabling global modeling with linear complexity. However, existing scanning strategies are not suitable for shadow removal, as they ignore the semantic continuity of shadow boundaries and internal regions. To address this, this paper proposes a boundary-region selective scanning mechanism that captures local details while enhancing semantic continuity between them, effectively improving shadow removal performance. In addition, a shadow mask denoising method is introduced to support the scanning mechanism and improve data quality. Based on these techniques, this paper presents a model called ShadowMamba, the first Mamba-based model designed for shadow removal. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches on the AISTD, ISTD, and SRD datasets, and also offers clear advantages in parameter efficiency and computational complexity.

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods. However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain. However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients, SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods. This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for adapting segment anything models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025.

While deep learning has led to impressive progress, it typically requires centralized data, which raises privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly solution, but general FL frameworks often struggle with low-level vision tasks, resulting in blurry, low-quality outputs. To address this, we introduce FedVSR, the first FL framework specifically designed for VSR. It is model-agnostic and stateless, and introduces a lightweight loss function based on the DWT to better preserve high-frequency details during local training. Additionally, a loss-aware aggregation strategy combines both DWT-based and task-specific losses to guide global updates effectively. Extensive experiments across multiple VSR models and datasets demonstrate that FedVSR consistently outperforms existing FL methods, achieving up to 0.82 dB higher PSNR, 0.0327 higher SSIM, and 0.0251 lower LPIPS. These results underscore FedVSR's ability to bridge the gap between privacy and performance, setting a new benchmark for federated learning in low-level vision tasks.

To address the challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible integration with various architectures and effective utilization of task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity. We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization, few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general low-level vision modeling.</p></details> |  |

Our system can transform images from extremely low resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at 256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery, fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g., NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research communities.

The emergence of Vision Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba (EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising, deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a significant 31-89% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining favorable performance compared to existing low-level Vision Mamba methods.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

However, most existing models assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution (LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal, restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred to as R\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://github.com/CMLab-Korea/Awesome-3D-Low-Level-Vision</p></details> |

Yet, their potential goes far beyond mere video generation. We argue that the training dynamics of VDMs, driven by the need to model coherent sequences, naturally pushes them to internalize structured representations and an implicit understanding of the visual world. To probe the extent of this internal knowledge, we introduce a few-shot fine-tuning framework that repurposes VDMs for new tasks using only a handful of examples. Our method transforms each task into a visual transition, enabling the training of LoRA weights on short input-output sequences without altering the generative interface of a frozen VDM. Despite minimal supervision, the model exhibits strong generalization across diverse tasks, from low-level vision (for example, segmentation and pose estimation) to high-level reasoning (for example, on ARC-AGI). These results reframe VDMs as more than generative engines. They are adaptable visual learners with the potential to serve as the backbone for future foundation models in vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 9 tables.

Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or video frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation and enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years, numerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly based on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures, loss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper presents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and video super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that existing datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in capturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that comprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected under diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure settings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional benchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization capabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on both public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a systematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising directions for future exploration. All datasets, methods, and evaluation metrics introduced in this work are publicly available and will be regularly updated.

However, most existing work focuses on reactive System 1 policies, underutilizing VLMs' strengths in semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. These System 2 capabilities-characterized by deliberative, goal-directed thinking-remain under explored due to the limited temporal scale and structural complexity of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce RoboCerebra, a benchmark for evaluating high-level reasoning in long-horizon robotic manipulation. RoboCerebra includes: (1) a large-scale simulation dataset with extended task horizons and diverse subtask sequences in household environments; (2) a hierarchical framework combining a high-level VLM planner with a low-level vision-language-action (VLA) controller; and (3) an evaluation protocol targeting planning, reflection, and memory through structured System 1-System 2 interaction. The dataset is constructed via a top-down pipeline, where GPT generates task instructions and decomposes them into subtask sequences. Human operators execute the subtasks in simulation, yielding high-quality trajectories with dynamic object variations. Compared to prior benchmarks, RoboCerebra features significantly longer action sequences and denser annotations. We further benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs as System 2 modules and analyze their performance across key cognitive dimensions, advancing the development of more capable and generalizable robotic planners.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 56K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications. We also demonstrate that our network generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks. We further propose a lighter version of SSGNet ($\sim$ 29K parameters) for depth computation, SSGNet-D, and successfully execute it on edge computing devices like Jetson AGX Orin, improving the performance of baseline network, even in the wild, with little computational delay.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 14 figures, journal extension version of SSGNet (https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/25322)</p></details> |

Existing methods struggle with distinguishing complex noise patterns in real-world scenes and consume significant computational resources due to reliance on Transformer-based models.

To improve computational efficiency, the Bidirectional WKV (BiWKV) mechanism is adopted, enabling full pixel-sequence interaction with linear complexity while overcoming the causal selection constraints. The model is validated on multiple real-world image denoising datasets, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and reducing inference time up to 40\%.

However, irregular rain patterns and complex geometric overlaps challenge single-paradigm architectures, necessitating a unified framework to integrate complementary global-local and spatial-channel representations. To address this, we propose a novel Cross Paradigm Representation and Alignment Transformer (CPRAformer). Its core idea is the hierarchical representation and alignment, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms (spatial-channel and global-local) to aid image reconstruction. It bridges the gap within and between paradigms, aligning and coordinating them to enable deep interaction and fusion of features. Specifically, we use two types of self-attention in the Transformer blocks: sparse prompt channel self-attention (SPC-SA) and spatial pixel refinement self-attention (SPR-SA). SPC-SA enhances global channel dependencies through dynamic sparsity, while SPR-SA focuses on spatial rain distribution and fine-grained texture recovery. To address the feature misalignment and knowledge differences between them, we introduce the Adaptive Alignment Frequency Module (AAFM), which aligns and interacts with features in a two-stage progressive manner, enabling adaptive guidance and complementarity. This reduces the information gap within and between paradigms. Through this unified cross-paradigm dynamic interaction framework, we achieve the extraction of the most valuable interactive fusion information from the two paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight benchmark datasets and further validates CPRAformer's robustness in other image restoration tasks and downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/zs1314/CPRAformer</p></details> |

Existing Mamba-based restoration methods process visual data by leveraging a flatten-and-scan strategy that converts image patches into a 1D sequence before scanning. However, this scanning paradigm ignores local pixel dependencies and introduces spatial misalignment by positioning distant pixels incorrectly adjacent, which reduces local noise-awareness and degrades image sharpness in low-level vision tasks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel slice-and-scan strategy that alternates scanning along intra- and inter-slices. We further design a new Vision State Space Module (VSSM) for image deblurring, and tackle the inefficiency challenges of the current Mamba-based vision module. Building upon this, we develop XYScanNet, an SSM architecture integrated with a lightweight feature fusion module for enhanced image deblurring. XYScanNet, maintains competitive distortion metrics and significantly improves perceptual performance. Experimental results show that XYScanNet enhances KID by $17\%$ compared to the nearest competitor.</p></details> |  |

OmniLV leverages both textual and visual prompts to offer flexible and user-friendly interactions. Built on Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based generative priors, our framework supports arbitrary resolutions -- achieving optimal performance at 1K resolution -- while preserving fine-grained details and high fidelity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that separately encoding text and visual instructions, combined with co-training using shallow feature control, is essential to mitigate task ambiguity and enhance multi-task generalization. Our findings also reveal that integrating high-level generative tasks into low-level vision models can compromise detail-sensitive restoration. These insights pave the way for more robust and generalizable low-level vision systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting Low-level Vision Models with Causal Effect Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19789v3)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of low-level vision tasks but also increased the difficulty of interpretability. A deep understanding of deep models is beneficial for both network design and practical reliability. To take up this challenge, we introduce causality theory to interpret low-level vision models and propose a model-/task-agnostic method called Causal Effect Map (CEM). With CEM, we can visualize and quantify the input-output relationships on either positive or negative effects. After analyzing various low-level vision tasks with CEM, we have reached several interesting insights, such as: (1) Using more information of input images (e.g., larger receptive field) does NOT always yield positive outcomes. (2) Attempting to incorporate mechanisms with a global receptive field (e.g., channel attention) into image denoising may prove futile. (3) Integrating multiple tasks to train a general model could encourage the network to prioritize local information over global context. Based on the causal effect theory, the proposed diagnostic tool can refresh our common knowledge and bring a deeper understanding of low-level vision models.

Specifically, on BlindTest, our suite of 7 very simple tasks, including identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) how many times two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) the number of circles in an Olympic-like logo, four state-of-the-art VLMs are only 58.07% accurate on average. Claude 3.5 Sonnet performs the best at 77.84% accuracy, far from the human expected accuracy of 100%. Across different image resolutions and line widths, VLMs including slow-thinking models consistently struggle with those tasks that require precise spatial information when geometric primitives overlap or are close. Yet, VLMs perform at near-100% accuracy when much more space is added to separate shapes and letters. Linear probing experiments show that vision encoders contain sufficient visual information to solve BlindTest and that language models fail to decode this information into correct answers.

| **[Mitigating Low-Level Visual Hallucinations Requires Self-Awareness: Database, Model and Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20673v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of multimodal large language models has resulted in remarkable advancements in visual perception and understanding, consolidating several tasks into a single visual question-answering framework. However, these models are prone to hallucinations, which limit their reliability as artificial intelligence systems. While this issue is extensively researched in natural language processing and image captioning, there remains a lack of investigation of hallucinations in Low-level Visual Perception and Understanding (HLPU), especially in the context of image quality assessment tasks. We consider that these hallucinations arise from an absence of clear self-awareness within the models. To address this issue, we first introduce the HLPU instruction database, the first instruction database specifically focused on hallucinations in low-level vision tasks. This database contains approximately 200K question-answer pairs and comprises four subsets, each covering different types of instructions. Subsequently, we propose the Self-Awareness Failure Elimination (SAFEQA) model, which utilizes image features, salient region features and quality features to improve the perception and comprehension abilities of the model in low-level vision tasks. Furthermore, we propose the Enhancing Self-Awareness Preference Optimization (ESA-PO) framework to increase the model's awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby mitigating the incidence of hallucination. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on low-level vision tasks, with the results demonstrating that our proposed method significantly enhances self-awareness of the model in these tasks and reduces hallucinations. Notably, our proposed method improves both accuracy and self-awareness of the proposed model and outperforms close-source models in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the shared principles between these tasks, they require recovering and preserving fine image details, whether by enhancing resolution for SISR or reconstructing compressed data for Image Compression. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on network architecture, our proposed approach utilizes a basis-coefficient decomposition as well as an explicit formulation of frequencies to capture structural components and multi-scale visual features in images, which addresses the core challenges of both tasks. We replace the representation of prior models from simple feature maps with Factorized Features to validate the potential for broad generalizability. In addition, we further optimize the pipelines by leveraging the mergeable-basis property of our Factorized Features, which consolidates shared structures on multi-frame compression and super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that our unified representation delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average relative improvement of 204.4% in PSNR over the baseline in Super-Resolution (SR) and 9.35% BD-rate reduction in Image Compression compared to the previous SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jayisaking.github.io/FIPER/</p></details> |

However, existing methods face several significant limitations: 1) requiring task- or dataset-specific models; 2) neglecting real-world image degradations (\textit{e.g.}, noise), which causes failure when processing degraded inputs; 3) operating in pixel space, where attention mechanisms are computationally expensive; and 4) lacking user interaction capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for multi-task, multi-degradation, and language-guided image fusion. Our framework includes two key components: 1) a practical degradation pipeline that simulates real-world image degradations and generates interactive prompts to guide the model; 2) an all-in-one Diffusion Transformer (DiT) operating in latent space, which fuses a clean image conditioned on both the degraded inputs and the generated prompts. Furthermore, we introduce principled modifications to the original DiT architecture to better suit the fusion task. Based on this framework, we develop two versions of the model: Regression-based and Flow Matching-based variants. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the aforementioned limitations and outperforms previous restoration+fusion and all-in-one pipelines.

Existing approaches typically predict blur kernels that are spatially invariant in each video frame or even the entire video. These methods do not consider potential spatio-temporal varying degradations in videos, resulting in suboptimal BVSR performance. In this context, we propose a novel BVSR model based on Implicit Kernels, BVSR-IK, which constructs a multi-scale kernel dictionary parameterized by implicit neural representations. It also employs a newly designed recurrent Transformer to predict the coefficient weights for accurate filtering in both frame correction and feature alignment. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed BVSR-IK, when compared with four state-of-the-art BVSR models on three commonly used datasets, with BVSR-IK outperforming the second best approach, FMA-Net, by up to 0.59 dB in PSNR.

| **[Contrast: A Hybrid Architecture of Transformers and State Space Models for Low-Level Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13353v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become increasingly popular for image super-resolution (SR) tasks due to their strong global context modeling capabilities. However, their quadratic computational complexity necessitates the use of window-based attention mechanisms, which restricts the receptive field and limits effective context expansion. Recently, the Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative with linear computational complexity, allowing it to avoid window mechanisms and maintain a large receptive field. Nevertheless, Mamba faces challenges in handling long-context dependencies when high pixel-level precision is required, as in SR tasks. This is due to its hidden state mechanism, which can compress and store a substantial amount of context but only in an approximate manner, leading to inaccuracies that transformers do not suffer from. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Contrast}, a hybrid SR model that combines \textbf{Con}volutional, \textbf{Tra}nsformer, and \textbf{St}ate Space components, effectively blending the strengths of transformers and Mamba to address their individual limitations. By integrating transformer and state space mechanisms, \textbf{Contrast} compensates for the shortcomings of each approach, enhancing both global context modeling and pixel-level accuracy. We demonstrate that combining these two architectures allows us to mitigate the problems inherent in each, resulting in improved performance on image super-resolution tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Owning to the hybrid image features and enhanced universal representations, the proposed GIFNet supports diverse fusion tasks, achieving high performance across both seen and unseen scenarios with a single model. Uniquely, experimental results reveal that our framework also supports single-modality enhancement, offering superior flexibility for practical applications.

Most state-of-the-art detectors only yield a binary decision, incapable of forgery localization, attribution of forgery methods, and providing analysis on the cause of forgeries. In this work, we integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) within DM-based face forensics, and propose a fine-grained analysis triad framework called VLForgery, that can 1) predict falsified facial images; 2) locate the falsified face regions subjected to partial synthesis; and 3) attribute the synthesis with specific generators. To achieve the above goals, we introduce VLF (Visual Language Forensics), a novel and diverse synthesis face dataset designed to facilitate rich interactions between Visual and Language modalities in MLLMs. Additionally, we propose an extrinsic knowledge-guided description method, termed EkCot, which leverages knowledge from the image generation pipeline to enable MLLMs to quickly capture image content. Furthermore, we introduce a low-level vision comparison pipeline designed to identify differential features between real and fake that MLLMs can inherently understand. These features are then incorporated into EkCot, enhancing its ability to analyze forgeries in a structured manner, following the sequence of detection, localization, and attribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLForgery outperforms other state-of-the-art forensic approaches in detection accuracy, with additional potential for falsified region localization and attribution analysis.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in low-level vision models. Image deraining is selected as a case study due to its well-defined and easily decoupled structure, allowing for more effective observation and analysis. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that the generalization issue is not primarily due to limited network capacity but rather the failure of existing training strategies, which leads networks to overfit specific degradation patterns. Our findings show that guiding networks to focus on learning the underlying image content, rather than the degradation patterns, is key to improving generalization. We demonstrate that balancing the complexity of background images and degradations in the training data helps networks better fit the image distribution. Furthermore, incorporating content priors from pre-trained generative models significantly enhances generalization. Experiments on both image deraining and image denoising validate the proposed strategies. We believe the insights and solutions will inspire further research and improve the generalization of low-level vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.15134</p></details> |

Among them, diffusion model-based solutions, characterized by a forward diffusion process and a reverse denoising process, have emerged as widely acclaimed for their ability to produce samples of superior quality and diversity. This ensures the generation of visually compelling results with intricate texture information. Despite their remarkable success, a noticeable gap exists in a comprehensive survey that amalgamates these pioneering diffusion model-based works and organizes the corresponding threads. This paper proposes the comprehensive review of diffusion model-based techniques. We present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks and explore their correlations with other deep generative models, establishing the theoretical foundation. Following this, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models, considering both the underlying framework and the target task. Additionally, we summarize extended diffusion models applied in other tasks, including medical, remote sensing, and video scenarios. Moreover, we provide an overview of commonly used benchmarks and evaluation metrics. We conduct a thorough evaluation, encompassing both performance and efficiency, of diffusion model-based techniques in three prominent tasks. Finally, we elucidate the limitations of current diffusion models and propose seven intriguing directions for future research.

Existing methods address this issue by improving data synthesis pipelines, estimating degradation kernels, employing deep internal learning, and performing domain adaptation and regularization. Previous domain adaptation methods have sought to bridge the domain gap by learning domain-invariant knowledge in either feature or pixel space. However, these techniques often struggle to extend to low-level vision tasks within a stable and compact framework. In this paper, we show that it is possible to perform domain adaptation via the noise space using diffusion models. In particular, by leveraging the unique property of how auxiliary conditional inputs influence the multi-step denoising process, we derive a meaningful diffusion loss that guides the restoration model in progressively aligning both restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution. We refer to this method as denoising as adaptation. To prevent shortcuts during joint training, we present crucial strategies such as channel-shuffling layer and residual-swapping contrastive learning in the diffusion model. They implicitly blur the boundaries between conditioned synthetic and real data and prevent the reliance of the model on easily distinguishable features. Experimental results on three classical image restoration tasks, namely denoising, deblurring, and deraining, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

The recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) feature spline-based convolutional layers and learnable activation functions, which can effectively capture nonlinear dependencies. In this paper, we design a KAN-Block based on KANs and innovatively apply it to low-light image enhancement. This method effectively alleviates the limitations of current methods constrained by linear network structures and lack of interpretability, further demonstrating the potential of KANs in low-level vision tasks. Given the poor perception of current low-light image enhancement methods and the stochastic nature of the inverse diffusion process, we further introduce frequency-domain perception for visually oriented enhancement.

Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.</p></details> |  |

First, we create a method that jointly estimates geometry and motion for accurate prediction. Second, we alleviate scene flow data scarcity with a data recipe that affords us 1M annotated training samples across diverse synthetic scenes. Third, we evaluate different parameterizations for scene flow prediction and adopt a natural and effective parameterization. Our resulting model outperforms existing methods as well as baselines built on large-scale models in terms of 3D end-point error, and shows zero-shot generalization to the casually captured videos from DAVIS and the robotic manipulation scenes from RoboTAP.

| **[Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20008v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (\ie, SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements.

However, existing All-in-One models are limited in terms of the range of tasks and performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Instruct-IPT -- an All-in-One Image Processing Transformer (IPT) that could effectively address manifold image restoration tasks with large inter-task gaps, such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and desnowing. While most research propose feature adaptation methods, we reveal their failure in addressing highly distinct tasks, and suggest weight modulation that adapts weights to specific tasks. Firstly, we search for task-sensitive weights and introduce task-specific biases on top of them. Secondly, we conduct rank analysis for a good compression strategy and perform low-rank decomposition on the biases. Thirdly, we propose synchronous training that updates the task-general backbone model and the task-specific biases simultaneously. In this way, the model is instructed to learn both general and task-specific knowledge. Via our simple yet effective method that instructs the IPT to be task experts, Instruct-IPT could better cooperate between tasks with distinct characteristics at humble costs. As an additional feature, we enable Instruct-IPT to receive human prompts. We have conducted experiments on Instruct-IPT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on manifold tasks, and we have effectively extended our method to diffusion denoisers as well.

With the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, transformer-based methods with pyramid structures have advanced the field by capturing long-range cross-scale spatial interaction. Despite its popularity, the degradation of essential features during the upsampling process notably compromised the restoration performance, resulting in suboptimal reconstruction outcomes. We introduce the EchoIR, an UNet-like image restoration network with a bilateral learnable upsampling mechanism to bridge this gap. Specifically, we proposed the Echo-Upsampler that optimizes the upsampling process by learning from the bilateral intermediate features of U-Net, the "Echo", aiming for a more refined restoration by minimizing the degradation during upsampling. In pursuit of modeling a hierarchical model of image restoration and upsampling tasks, we propose the Approximated Sequential Bi-level Optimization (AS-BLO), an advanced bi-level optimization model establishing a relationship between upsampling learning and image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate the proposed EchoIR surpasses the existing methods, achieving SOTA performance in image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike CNN-based models, Transformers are more adept at capturing long-range dependencies, enabling the reconstruction of images utilizing non-local information. In the domain of super-resolution, Swin-transformer-based models have become mainstream due to their capability of global spatial information modeling and their shifting-window attention mechanism that facilitates the interchange of information between different windows. Many researchers have enhanced model performance by expanding the receptive fields or designing meticulous networks, yielding commendable results. However, we observed that it is a general phenomenon for the feature map intensity to be abruptly suppressed to small values towards the network's end. This implies an information bottleneck and a diminishment of spatial information, implicitly limiting the model's potential. To address this, we propose the Dense-residual-connected Transformer (DRCT), aimed at mitigating the loss of spatial information and stabilizing the information flow through dense-residual connections between layers, thereby unleashing the model's potential and saving the model away from information bottleneck.

Current approaches to address SR tasks, such as transformer-based and diffusion-based methods, are either dedicated to extracting RGB image features or assuming similar degradation patterns, neglecting the inherent modal disparities between infrared and visible images. When directly applied to infrared image SR tasks, these methods inevitably distort the infrared spectral distribution, compromising the machine perception in downstream tasks. In this work, we emphasize the infrared spectral distribution fidelity and propose a Contourlet refinement gate framework to restore infrared modal-specific features while preserving spectral distribution fidelity. Our approach captures high-pass subbands from multi-scale and multi-directional infrared spectral decomposition to recover infrared-degraded information through a gate architecture. The proposed Spectral Fidelity Loss regularizes the spectral frequency distribution during reconstruction, which ensures the preservation of both high- and low-frequency components and maintains the fidelity of infrared-specific features. We propose a two-stage prompt-learning optimization to guide the model in learning infrared HR characteristics from LR degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing image SR models in both visual and perceptual tasks while notably enhancing machine perception in downstream tasks.

Recently, denoising diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image synthesis. Guided diffusion models, leveraging the potent generative priors of pre-trained models along with a differential guidance loss, have achieved promising results in blind image restoration. However, these models typically consider data consistency solely in the spatial domain, often resulting in distorted image content. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-aware guidance loss that can be integrated into various diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Our proposed guidance loss, based on 2D discrete wavelet transform, simultaneously enforces content consistency in both the spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in three blind restoration tasks: blind image deblurring, imaging through turbulence, and blind restoration for multiple degradations. Notably, our method achieves a significant improvement in PSNR score, with a remarkable enhancement of 3.72\,dB in image deblurring. Moreover, our method exhibits superior capability in generating images with rich details and reduced distortion, leading to the best visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, has been accepted by the ECCV 2024: AIM workshop</p></details> |

In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models (all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for unpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a degradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map. Specifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT objective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier residual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for restoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is computed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings to condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects intrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and structural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT map, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one restoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the favorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in terms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure preservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world scenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to both degradation levels and the number of degradations.</p></details> |  |

The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We combine pixel-wise noise modeling networks based on Normalizing Flows and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. Specifically, the pixel-wise noise modeling network leverages the high training stability of Normalizing Flows to capture noise characteristics that are affected by a multitude of factors, and the spatial correlation networks efficiently model pixel-to-pixel relationships. In particular, unlike recent methods that rely on paired noisy images, our method synthesizes noise using clean images and factors that affect noise characteristics, such as easily obtainable parameters like camera type and ISO settings, making it applicable to various fields where obtaining noisy-clean image pairs is not feasible. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines in the sRGB noise synthesis task. Moreover, the denoising neural network trained with synthesized image pairs from our model shows superior performance compared to other baselines.

| **[MambaIR: A Simple Baseline for Image Restoration with State-Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15648v3)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen significant advancements in image restoration, largely attributed to the development of modern deep neural networks, such as CNNs and Transformers. However, existing restoration backbones often face the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation, hindering their application in practice. Recently, the Selective Structured State Space Model, especially the improved version Mamba, has shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, which offers a way to resolve the above dilemma. However, the standard Mamba still faces certain challenges in low-level vision such as local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy. In this work, we introduce a simple but effective baseline, named MambaIR, which introduces both local enhancement and channel attention to improve the vanilla Mamba. In this way, our MambaIR takes advantage of the local pixel similarity and reduces the channel redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, for example, MambaIR outperforms SwinIR by up to 0.45dB on image SR, using similar computational cost but with a global receptive field.

| **[Hi-Mamba: Hierarchical Mamba for Efficient Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10140v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSM), such as Mamba, have shown strong representation ability in modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity, achieving successful applications from high-level to low-level vision tasks. However, SSM's sequential nature necessitates multiple scans in different directions to compensate for the loss of spatial dependency when unfolding the image into a 1D sequence. This multi-direction scanning strategy significantly increases the computation overhead and is unbearable for high-resolution image processing. To address this problem, we propose a novel Hierarchical Mamba network, namely, Hi-Mamba, for image super-resolution (SR). Hi-Mamba consists of two key designs: (1) The Hierarchical Mamba Block (HMB) assembled by a Local SSM (L-SSM) and a Region SSM (R-SSM) both with the single-direction scanning, aggregates multi-scale representations to enhance the context modeling ability. (2) The Direction Alternation Hierarchical Mamba Group (DA-HMG) allocates the isomeric single-direction scanning into cascading HMBs to enrich the spatial relationship modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Hi-Mamba across five benchmark datasets for efficient SR. For example, Hi-Mamba achieves a significant PSNR improvement of 0.29 dB on Manga109 for $\times3$ SR, compared to the strong lightweight MambaIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-LLIE: Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning with Mamba-based Low-light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16604v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive advancements made in recent low-light image enhancement techniques, the scarcity of paired data has emerged as a significant obstacle to further advancements. This work proposes a mean-teacher-based semi-supervised low-light enhancement (Semi-LLIE) framework that integrates the unpaired data into model training. The mean-teacher technique is a prominent semi-supervised learning method, successfully adopted for addressing high-level and low-level vision tasks. However, two primary issues hinder the naive mean-teacher method from attaining optimal performance in low-light image enhancement. Firstly, pixel-wise consistency loss is insufficient for transferring realistic illumination distribution from the teacher to the student model, which results in color cast in the enhanced images. Secondly, cutting-edge image enhancement approaches fail to effectively cooperate with the mean-teacher framework to restore detailed information in dark areas due to their tendency to overlook modeling structured information within local regions. To mitigate the above issues, we first introduce a semantic-aware contrastive loss to faithfully transfer the illumination distribution, contributing to enhancing images with natural colors. Then, we design a Mamba-based low-light image enhancement backbone to effectively enhance Mamba's local region pixel relationship representation ability with a multi-scale feature learning scheme, facilitating the generation of images with rich textural details. Further, we propose novel perceptive loss based on the large-scale vision-language Recognize Anything Model (RAM) to help generate enhanced images with richer textual details. The experimental results indicate that our Semi-LLIE surpasses existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explore the Hallucination on Low-level Perception for MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09748v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly influenced various aspects of industry and daily life, showcasing impressive capabilities in visual perception and understanding. However, these models also exhibit hallucinations, which limit their reliability as AI systems, especially in tasks involving low-level visual perception and understanding. We believe that hallucinations stem from a lack of explicit self-awareness in these models, which directly impacts their overall performance. In this paper, we aim to define and evaluate the self-awareness of MLLMs in low-level visual perception and understanding tasks. To this end, we present QL-Bench, a benchmark settings to simulate human responses to low-level vision, investigating self-awareness in low-level visual perception through visual question answering related to low-level attributes such as clarity and lighting. Specifically, we construct the LLSAVisionQA dataset, comprising 2,990 single images and 1,999 image pairs, each accompanied by an open-ended question about its low-level features. Through the evaluation of 15 MLLMs, we demonstrate that while some models exhibit robust low-level visual capabilities, their self-awareness remains relatively underdeveloped. Notably, for the same model, simpler questions are often answered more accurately than complex ones. However, self-awareness appears to improve when addressing more challenging questions. We hope that our benchmark will motivate further research, particularly focused on enhancing the self-awareness of MLLMs in tasks involving low-level visual perception and understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, they often overlook the correlation between these channels, leading to color distortion and artifacts in the reconstructed image. To address this, we present Quaternion Nuclear Norm Minus Frobenius Norm Minimization (QNMF), a novel approach for color image reconstruction. QNMF utilizes quaternion algebra to capture the relationships among RGB channels comprehensively. By employing a regularization technique that involves nuclear norm minus Frobenius norm, QNMF approximates the underlying low-rank structure of quaternion-encoded color images. Theoretical proofs are provided to ensure the method's mathematical integrity. Demonstrating versatility and efficacy, the QNMF regularizer excels in various color low-level vision tasks, including denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and random impulse noise removal, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by Pattern Recognition on September 5, 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a self-supervised multi-scale blind image deblurring method to jointly estimate the latent image and the blur kernel via alternating optimization. In the image estimation step, we construct a multi-scale generator network with multiple inputs and multiple outputs to collaboratively estimate latent images at various scales, supervised by an image pyramid constructed from only the blurred image. This generator places architectural constraints on the network and avoids the need for mathematical expression of image priors. In the blur kernel estimation step, the blur kernel at each scale is independently estimated with a direct solution to a quadratic regularized least-squares model for its flexible adaptation to the proposed multi-scale generator for image estimation. Thanks to the collaborative estimation across multiple scales, our method avoids the computationally intensive coarse-to-fine propagation and additional image deblurring processes used in traditional mathematical optimization-based methods. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, especially for handling large and real-world blurs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures, 94 references</p></details> |
| **[MMDRFuse: Distilled Mini-Model with Dynamic Refresh for Multi-Modality Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15641v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Multi-Modality Image Fusion (MMIF) has been applied to many fields, which has attracted many scholars to endeavour to improve the fusion performance. However, the prevailing focus has predominantly been on the architecture design, rather than the training strategies. As a low-level vision task, image fusion is supposed to quickly deliver output images for observation and supporting downstream tasks. Thus, superfluous computational and storage overheads should be avoided. In this work, a lightweight Distilled Mini-Model with a Dynamic Refresh strategy (MMDRFuse) is proposed to achieve this objective. To pursue model parsimony, an extremely small convolutional network with a total of 113 trainable parameters (0.44 KB) is obtained by three carefully designed supervisions. First, digestible distillation is constructed by emphasising external spatial feature consistency, delivering soft supervision with balanced details and saliency for the target network. Second, we develop a comprehensive loss to balance the pixel, gradient, and perception clues from the source images. Third, an innovative dynamic refresh training strategy is used to collaborate history parameters and current supervision during training, together with an adaptive adjust function to optimise the fusion network. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits promising advantages in terms of model efficiency and complexity, with superior performance in multiple image fusion tasks and downstream pedestrian detection application. The code of this work is publicly available at https://github.com/yanglinDeng/MMDRFuse.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, accpeted by ACM International Conference on Multimedia 2024(Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Learning A Low-Level Vision Generalist via Visual Task Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08601v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a unified model for general low-level vision tasks holds significant research and practical value. Current methods encounter several critical issues. Multi-task restoration approaches can address multiple degradation-to-clean restoration tasks, while their applicability to tasks with different target domains (e.g., image stylization) is limited. Methods like PromptGIP can handle multiple input-target domains but rely on the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) paradigm. Consequently, they are tied to the ViT architecture, resulting in suboptimal image reconstruction quality. In addition, these methods are sensitive to prompt image content and often struggle with low-frequency information processing. In this paper, we propose a Visual task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework to overcome these challenges. VPIP employs visual task prompts to manage tasks with different input-target domains and allows flexible selection of backbone network suitable for general tasks. Besides, a new prompt cross-attention is introduced to facilitate interaction between the input and prompt information. Based on the VPIP framework, we train a low-level vision generalist model, namely GenLV, on 30 diverse tasks. Experimental results show that GenLV can successfully address a variety of low-level tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, evaluating MLLMs in low-level visual perception and understanding remains a yet-to-explore domain. To this end, we design benchmark settings to emulate human language responses related to low-level vision: the low-level visual perception (A1) via visual question answering related to low-level attributes (e.g. clarity, lighting); and the low-level visual description (A2), on evaluating MLLMs for low-level text descriptions. Furthermore, given that pairwise comparison can better avoid ambiguity of responses and has been adopted by many human experiments, we further extend the low-level perception-related question-answering and description evaluations of MLLMs from single images to image pairs. Specifically, for perception (A1), we carry out the LLVisionQA+ dataset, comprising 2,990 single images and 1,999 image pairs each accompanied by an open-ended question about its low-level features; for description (A2), we propose the LLDescribe+ dataset, evaluating MLLMs for low-level descriptions on 499 single images and 450 pairs. Additionally, we evaluate MLLMs on assessment (A3) ability, i.e. predicting score, by employing a softmax-based approach to enable all MLLMs to generate quantifiable quality ratings, tested against human opinions in 7 image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. With 24 MLLMs under evaluation, we demonstrate that several MLLMs have decent low-level visual competencies on single images, but only GPT-4V exhibits higher accuracy on pairwise comparisons than single image evaluations (like humans). We hope that our benchmark will motivate further research into uncovering and enhancing these nascent capabilities of MLLMs. Datasets will be available at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.14181</p></details> |

Given LMMs' exceptional performance and robustness in low-level vision and quality assessment tasks, this study aims to investigate the feasibility of imparting PCQA knowledge to LMMs through text supervision. To achieve this, we transform quality labels into textual descriptions during the fine-tuning phase, enabling LMMs to derive quality rating logits from 2D projections of point clouds. To compensate for the loss of perception in the 3D domain, structural features are extracted as well. These quality logits and structural features are then combined and regressed into quality scores. Our experimental results affirm the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing a novel integration of LMMs into PCQA that enhances model understanding and assessment accuracy. We hope our contributions can inspire subsequent investigations into the fusion of LMMs with PCQA, fostering advancements in 3D visual quality analysis and beyond.

| **[UniProcessor: A Text-induced Unified Low-level Image Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20928v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image processing, including image restoration, image enhancement, etc., involves generating a high-quality clean image from a degraded input. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Difflare: Removing Image Lens Flare with Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14746v1)** | 2024-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recovery of high-quality images from images corrupted by lens flare presents a significant challenge in low-level vision. Contemporary deep learning methods frequently entail training a lens flare removing model from scratch. However, these methods, despite their noticeable success, fail to utilize the generative prior learned by pre-trained models, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in lens flare removal. Furthermore, there are only few works considering the physical priors relevant to flare removal. To address these issues, we introduce Difflare, a novel approach designed for lens flare removal. To leverage the generative prior learned by Pre-Trained Diffusion Models (PTDM), we introduce a trainable Structural Guidance Injection Module (SGIM) aimed at guiding the restoration process with PTDM. Towards more efficient training, we employ Difflare in the latent space. To address information loss resulting from latent compression and the stochastic sampling process of PTDM, we introduce an Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (AFFM), which incorporates the Luminance Gradient Prior (LGP) of lens flare to dynamically regulate feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed Difflare achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world lens flare removal, restoring images corrupted by flare with improved fidelity and perceptual quality.

| **[Shape Prior Segmentation Guided by Harmonic Beltrami Signature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04360v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel shape prior segmentation method guided by the Harmonic Beltrami Signature (HBS). The HBS is a shape representation fully capturing 2D simply connected shapes, exhibiting resilience against perturbations and invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. The proposed method integrates the HBS within a quasi-conformal topology preserving segmentation framework, leveraging shape prior knowledge to significantly enhance segmentation performance, especially for low-quality or occluded images. The key innovation lies in the bifurcation of the optimization process into two iterative stages: 1) The computation of a quasi-conformal deformation map, which transforms the unit disk into the targeted segmentation area, driven by image data and other regularization terms; 2) The subsequent refinement of this map is contingent upon minimizing the $L_2$ distance between its Beltrami coefficient and the reference HBS. This shape-constrained refinement ensures that the segmentation adheres to the reference shape(s) by exploiting the inherent invariance, robustness, and discerning shape discriminative capabilities afforded by the HBS. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images validate the method's ability to improve segmentation accuracy over baselines, eliminate preprocessing requirements, resist noise corruption, and flexibly acquire and apply shape priors. Overall, the HBS segmentation framework offers an efficient strategy to robustly incorporate the shape prior knowledge, thereby advancing critical low-level vision tasks.</p></details> | 34 pages, 15 figures |

However, conventional imaging systems come with sophisticated lens designs and heavy optical components. This disqualifies their usage in many mobile and wearable applications where thin and portable, minimalist imaging systems are desired. In this paper, we propose a Panoramic Computational Imaging Engine (PCIE) to achieve minimalist and high-quality panoramic imaging. With less than three spherical lenses, a Minimalist Panoramic Imaging Prototype (MPIP) is constructed based on the design of the Panoramic Annular Lens (PAL), but with low-quality imaging results due to aberrations and small image plane size. We propose two pipelines, i.e. Aberration Correction (AC) and Super-Resolution and Aberration Correction (SR&AC), to solve the image quality problems of MPIP, with imaging sensors of small and large pixel size, respectively. To leverage the prior information of the optical system, we propose a Point Spread Function (PSF) representation method to produce a PSF map as an additional modality. A PSF-aware Aberration-image Recovery Transformer (PART) is designed as a universal network for the two pipelines, in which the self-attention calculation and feature extraction are guided by the PSF map. We train PART on synthetic image pairs from simulation and put forward the PALHQ dataset to fill the gap of real-world high-quality PAL images for low-level vision. A comprehensive variety of experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrates the impressive imaging results of PCIE and the effectiveness of the PSF representation. We further deliver heuristic experimental findings for minimalist and high-quality panoramic imaging.

Another concern often encountered is the unsatisfying results yielded when directly applying pre-trained single-image models to multi-image domain. In this paper, we propose a efficient method for transferring a pre-trained single-image super-resolution (SISR) transformer network to the domain of stereo image super-resolution (SteISR) through a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Specifically, we introduce the concept of stereo adapters and spatial adapters which are incorporated into the pre-trained SISR transformer network. Subsequently, the pre-trained SISR model is frozen, enabling us to fine-tune the adapters using stereo datasets along. By adopting this training method, we enhance the ability of the SISR model to accurately infer stereo images by 0.79dB on the Flickr1024 dataset. This method allows us to train only 4.8% of the original model parameters, achieving state-of-the-art performance on four commonly used SteISR benchmarks. Compared to the more complicated full fine-tuning approach, our method reduces training time and memory consumption by 57% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The width of networks, defined as the size of the receptive fields and the density of the channels, has demonstrated crucial importance in low-level vision tasks such as image denoising and restoration. However, the limited generalization ability, due to the increased width of networks, creates a bottleneck in designing wider networks. In this paper, we propose the Deep Regulated Convolutional Network (RC-Net), a deep network composed of regulated sub-network blocks cascaded by skip-connections, to overcome this bottleneck. Specifically, the Regulated Convolution block (RC-block), featured by a combination of large and small convolution filters, balances the effectiveness of prominent feature extraction and the generalization ability of the network. RC-Nets have several compelling advantages: they embrace diversified features through large-small filter combinations, alleviate the hazy boundary and blurred details in image denoising and super-resolution problems, and stabilize the learning process. Our proposed RC-Nets outperform state-of-the-art approaches with significant performance gains in various image restoration tasks while demonstrating promising generalization ability.

To this end, we propose an effective generative model which utilizes clean features as guidance followed by noise injections into the network. Specifically, our generator follows a UNet-like structure with skip connections but without downsampling and upsampling layers. Firstly, we extract deep features from a clean image as the guidance and concatenate a Gaussian noise map to the transition point between the encoder and decoder as the noise source. Secondly, we propose noise synthesis blocks in the decoder in each of which we inject Gaussian noise to model the noise characteristics. Thirdly, we propose to utilize an additional Style Loss and demonstrate that this allows better noise characteristics supervision in the generator. Through a number of new experiments, we evaluate the temporal variance and the spatial correlation of the generated noise which we hope can provide meaningful insights for future works. Finally, we show that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods for synthesizing camera noise.</p></details> |  |

Though MLLMs have shown promising results in numerous high-level vision and vision-language tasks such as VQA and text-to-image, no works have demonstrated how low-level vision tasks can benefit from MLLMs. We find that most current MLLMs are blind to low-level features due to their design of vision modules, thus are inherently incapable for solving low-level vision tasks. In this work, we purpose $\textbf{LM4LV}$, a framework that enables a FROZEN LLM to solve a range of low-level vision tasks without any multi-modal data or prior. This showcases the LLM's strong potential in low-level vision and bridges the gap between MLLMs and low-level vision tasks.

We then propose a Plugin-Selector that can automatically select different Task-Plugins based on the text instruction, allowing users to edit images by indicating multiple low-level tasks with natural language. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 low-level vision tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of Diff-Plugin over existing methods, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Many deep learning methods with powerful representation learning capability demonstrate advanced performance on non-homogeneous dehazing, however, these methods usually struggle with processing high-resolution images (e.g., $4000 \times 6000$) due to their heavy computational demands. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative non-homogeneous Dehazing method via Deformable Convolutional Transformer-like architecture (DehazeDCT). Specifically, we first design a transformer-like network based on deformable convolution v4, which offers long-range dependency and adaptive spatial aggregation capabilities and demonstrates faster convergence and forward speed. Furthermore, we leverage a lightweight Retinex-inspired transformer to achieve color correction and structure refinement.

| **[A Survey on Visual Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15956v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architectures, namely Mamba, have recently demonstrated significant promise in long-sequence modeling. Since the self-attention mechanism in transformers has quadratic complexity with image size and increasing computational demands, the researchers are now exploring how to adapt Mamba for computer vision tasks. This paper is the first comprehensive survey aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of Mamba models in the field of computer vision. It begins by exploring the foundational concepts contributing to Mamba's success, including the state space model framework, selection mechanisms, and hardware-aware design. Next, we review these vision mamba models by categorizing them into foundational ones and enhancing them with techniques such as convolution, recurrence, and attention to improve their sophistication. We further delve into the widespread applications of Mamba in vision tasks, which include their use as a backbone in various levels of vision processing. This encompasses general visual tasks, Medical visual tasks (e.g., 2D / 3D segmentation, classification, and image registration, etc.), and Remote Sensing visual tasks. We specially introduce general visual tasks from two levels: High/Mid-level vision (e.g., Object detection, Segmentation, Video classification, etc.) and Low-level vision (e.g., Image super-resolution, Image restoration, Visual generation, etc.). We hope this endeavor will spark additional interest within the community to address current challenges and further apply Mamba models in computer vision.</p></details> |  |

However, early Transformer-based approaches that rely on self-attention within non-overlapping windows encounter challenges in acquiring global information. To activate more input pixels globally, hybrid attention models have been proposed. Moreover, training by solely minimizing pixel-wise RGB losses, such as L1, have been found inadequate for capturing essential high-frequency details. This paper presents two contributions: i) We introduce convolutional non-local sparse attention (NLSA) blocks to extend the hybrid transformer architecture in order to further enhance its receptive field. ii) We employ wavelet losses to train Transformer models to improve quantitative and subjective performance. While wavelet losses have been explored previously, showing their power in training Transformer-based SR models is novel. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model provides state-of-the-art PSNR results as well as superior visual performance across various benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>total...</summary><p>total of 10 pages including references, 5 tables and 5 figures, accepted for NTIRE 2024 Single Image Super Resolution (x4) challenge</p></details> |

Although yielding impressive results, the impact of the language prior, particularly in terms of generalization and robustness, remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by quantifying the impact of this prior and introduce methods to benchmark its effectiveness across various settings. We generate "low-level" sentences that convey object-centric, three-dimensional spatial relationships, incorporate them as additional language priors and evaluate their downstream impact on depth estimation. Our key finding is that current language-guided depth estimators perform optimally only with scene-level descriptions and counter-intuitively fare worse with low level descriptions. Despite leveraging additional data, these methods are not robust to directed adversarial attacks and decline in performance with an increase in distribution shift. Finally, to provide a foundation for future research, we identify points of failures and offer insights to better understand these shortcomings. With an increasing number of methods using language for depth estimation, our findings highlight the opportunities and pitfalls that require careful consideration for effective deployment in real-world settings</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024.

Previous methods mitigate this issue by exploring image enhancement or object detection techniques with real low-light image datasets. However, the progress is impeded by the inherent difficulties about collecting and annotating low-light images. To address this challenge, we propose to boost low-light object detection with zero-shot day-night domain adaptation, which aims to generalize a detector from well-lit scenarios to low-light ones without requiring real low-light data. Revisiting Retinex theory in the low-level vision, we first design a reflectance representation learning module to learn Retinex-based illumination invariance in images with a carefully designed illumination invariance reinforcement strategy. Next, an interchange-redecomposition-coherence procedure is introduced to improve over the vanilla Retinex image decomposition process by performing two sequential image decompositions and introducing a redecomposition cohering loss. Extensive experiments on ExDark, DARK FACE, and CODaN datasets show strong low-light generalizability of our method.

This paper introduces MPerceiver: a novel multimodal prompt learning approach that harnesses Stable Diffusion (SD) priors to enhance adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity for all-in-one image restoration. Specifically, we develop a dual-branch module to master two types of SD prompts: textual for holistic representation and visual for multiscale detail representation. Both prompts are dynamically adjusted by degradation predictions from the CLIP image encoder, enabling adaptive responses to diverse unknown degradations. Moreover, a plug-in detail refinement module improves restoration fidelity via direct encoder-to-decoder information transformation. To assess our method, MPerceiver is trained on 9 tasks for all-in-one IR and outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific methods across most tasks. Post multitask pre-training, MPerceiver attains a generalized representation in low-level vision, exhibiting remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks. Extensive experiments on 16 IR tasks underscore the superiority of MPerceiver in terms of adaptiveness, generalizability and fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

On the other hand, GAN-based diverse image generative methods require retraining/fine-tuning the network or designing complex noise injection functions, which is computationally expensive, task-specific, or struggle to generate high-quality results. Given that many deterministic conditional image generative models have been able to produce high-quality yet fixed results, we raise an intriguing question: is it possible for pre-trained deterministic conditional image generative models to generate diverse results without changing network structures or parameters? To answer this question, we re-examine the conditional image generation tasks from the perspective of adversarial attack and propose a simple and efficient plug-in projected gradient descent (PGD) like method for diverse and controllable image generation. The key idea is attacking the pre-trained deterministic generative models by adding a micro perturbation to the input condition. In this way, diverse results can be generated without any adjustment of network structures or fine-tuning of the pre-trained models. In addition, we can also control the diverse results to be generated by specifying the attack direction according to a reference text or image. Our work opens the door to applying adversarial attack to low-level vision tasks, and experiments on various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, accepted by AAAI24</p></details> |

However, when it comes to low-level vision such as image restoration their performance deteriorates dramatically due to corrupted inputs. In this paper, we present a degradation-aware vision-language model (DA-CLIP) to better transfer pretrained vision-language models to low-level vision tasks as a multi-task framework for image restoration. More specifically, DA-CLIP trains an additional controller that adapts the fixed CLIP image encoder to predict high-quality feature embeddings. By integrating the embedding into an image restoration network via cross-attention, we are able to pilot the model to learn a high-fidelity image reconstruction. The controller itself will also output a degradation feature that matches the real corruptions of the input, yielding a natural classifier for different degradation types. In addition, we construct a mixed degradation dataset with synthetic captions for DA-CLIP training. Our approach advances state-of-the-art performance on both \emph{degradation-specific} and \emph{unified} image restoration tasks, showing a promising direction of prompting image restoration with large-scale pretrained vision-language models.

| **[Unifying Image Processing as Visual Prompting Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10513v2)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image processing is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims at enhancing image quality and extracting essential features for subsequent vision applications. Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individual tasks and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), there is a similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developing large-scale models through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigm shift reduces the reliance on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unified model to deal with various tasks. However, these advances have predominantly concentrated on high-level vision tasks, with less attention paid to low-level vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a universal model for general image processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, image feature extraction tasks, etc. Our proposed framework, named PromptGIP, unifies these diverse image processing tasks within a universal framework. Inspired by NLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ a visual prompting question answering paradigm. Specifically, we treat the input-output image pair as a structured question-answer sentence, thereby reprogramming the image processing task as a prompting QA problem. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domain tasks using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for task-specific finetuning. Our methodology offers a universal and adaptive solution to general image processing. While PromptGIP has demonstrated a certain degree of out-of-domain task generalization capability, further research is expected to fully explore its more powerful emergent generalization.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |

Beyond visual text detection and recognition, the field of visual text processing has experienced a surge in research, driven by the advent of fundamental generative models. However, challenges persist due to the unique properties and features that distinguish text from general objects. Effectively leveraging these unique textual characteristics is crucial in visual text processing, as observed in our study. In this survey, we present a comprehensive, multi-perspective analysis of recent advancements in this field. Initially, we introduce a hierarchical taxonomy encompassing areas ranging from text image enhancement and restoration to text image manipulation, followed by different learning paradigms. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth discussion of how specific textual features such as structure, stroke, semantics, style, and spatial context are seamlessly integrated into various tasks. Furthermore, we explore available public datasets and benchmark the reviewed methods on several widely-used datasets. Finally, we identify principal challenges and potential avenues for future research. Our aim is to establish this survey as a fundamental resource, fostering continued exploration and innovation in the dynamic area of visual text processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from History: Task-agnostic Model Contrastive Learning for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06023v5)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has emerged as a prevailing paradigm for high-level vision tasks, which, by introducing properly negative samples, has also been exploited for low-level vision tasks to achieve a compact optimization space to account for their ill-posed nature. However, existing methods rely on manually predefined and task-oriented negatives, which often exhibit pronounced task-specific biases. To address this challenge, our paper introduces an innovative method termed 'learning from history', which dynamically generates negative samples from the target model itself. Our approach, named Model Contrastive Learning for Image Restoration (MCLIR), rejuvenates latency models as negative models, making it compatible with diverse image restoration tasks. We propose the Self-Prior guided Negative loss (SPN) to enable it. This approach significantly enhances existing models when retrained with the proposed model contrastive paradigm. The results show significant improvements in image restoration across various tasks and architectures. For example, models retrained with SPN outperform the original FFANet and DehazeFormer by 3.41 dB and 0.57 dB on the RESIDE indoor dataset for image dehazing. Similarly, they achieve notable improvements of 0.47 dB on SPA-Data over IDT for image deraining and 0.12 dB on Manga109 for a 4x scale super-resolution over lightweight SwinIR, respectively.

However, it still remains an open research problem on applying MLLMs to low-level vision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple MLLM-based Image Restoration framework to address this gap, namely Multi-modal Large Language Model based Restoration Assistant (LLMRA). We exploit the impressive capabilities of MLLMs to obtain the degradation information for universal image restoration. By employing a pretrained multi-modal large language model and a vision language model, we generate text descriptions and encode them as context embedding with degradation information for the degraded image. Through the proposed Context Enhance Module (CEM) and Degradation Context based Transformer Network (DC-former), we integrate these context embedding into the restoration network, contributing to more accurate and adjustable image restoration. Based on the dialogue with the users, our method leverages image degradation priors from MLLMs, providing low-level attributes descriptions of the input low-quality images and the restored high-quality images simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our LLMRA in universal image restoration tasks.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there is still an inadequacy in assessing the abilities of MLLMs on low-level visual perception and understanding. To address this gap, we present Q-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate potential abilities of MLLMs on three realms: low-level visual perception, low-level visual description, and overall visual quality assessment. a) To evaluate the low-level perception ability, we construct the LLVisionQA dataset, consisting of 2,990 diverse-sourced images, each equipped with a human-asked question focusing on its low-level attributes. We then measure the correctness of MLLMs on answering these questions. b) To examine the description ability of MLLMs on low-level information, we propose the LLDescribe dataset consisting of long expert-labelled golden low-level text descriptions on 499 images, and a GPT-involved comparison pipeline between outputs of MLLMs and the golden descriptions. c) Besides these two tasks, we further measure their visual quality assessment ability to align with human opinion scores. Specifically, we design a softmax-based strategy that enables MLLMs to predict quantifiable quality scores, and evaluate them on various existing image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. Our evaluation across the three abilities confirms that MLLMs possess preliminary low-level visual skills. However, these skills are still unstable and relatively imprecise, indicating the need for specific enhancements on MLLMs towards these abilities. We hope that our benchmark can encourage the research community to delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of MLLMs. Project Page: https://q-future.github.io/Q-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 tables, with updated results</p></details> |

However, the exploration of MLLM potential in visual quality assessment, a vital aspect of low-level vision, remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce Q-Boost, a novel strategy designed to enhance low-level MLLMs in image quality assessment (IQA) and video quality assessment (VQA) tasks, which is structured around two pivotal components: 1) Triadic-Tone Integration: Ordinary prompt design simply oscillates between the binary extremes of $positive$ and $negative$. Q-Boost innovates by incorporating a `middle ground' approach through $neutral$ prompts, allowing for a more balanced and detailed assessment. 2) Multi-Prompt Ensemble: Multiple quality-centric prompts are used to mitigate bias and acquire more accurate evaluation. The experimental results show that the low-level MLLMs exhibit outstanding zeros-shot performance on the IQA/VQA tasks equipped with the Q-Boost strategy.</p></details> |  |

One would use the temporal information from adjacent frames to make video restoration successful. Recently, the success of the Transformer has raised awareness in the computer-vision community. However, its self-attention mechanism requires much memory, which is unsuitable for high-resolution vision tasks like video restoration. In this paper, we propose ViStripformer (Video Stripformer), which utilizes spatio-temporal strip attention to catch long-range data correlations, consisting of intra-frame strip attention (Intra-SA) and inter-frame strip attention (Inter-SA) for extracting spatial and temporal information. It decomposes video frames into strip-shaped features in horizontal and vertical directions for Intra-SA and Inter-SA to address degradation patterns with various orientations and magnitudes. Besides, ViStripformer is an effective and efficient transformer architecture with much lower memory usage than the vanilla transformer. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves superior results with fast inference time on video restoration tasks, including video deblurring, demoireing, and deraining.</p></details> |  |

For decades, it has been known that these problems can be elegantly formulated as discrete energy minimization problems derived from probabilistic graphical models (such as Markov Random Fields). Despite recent advances in inference algorithms (such as graph-cut and message-passing algorithms), the resulting energy minimization problems are generally viewed as intractable. The emergence of quantum computations, which offer the potential for faster solutions to certain problems than classical methods, has led to an increased interest in utilizing quantum properties to overcome intractable problems. Recently, there has also been a growing interest in Quantum Computer Vision (QCV), with the hope of providing a credible alternative or assistant to deep learning solutions in the field. This study investigates a new Quantum Annealing based inference algorithm for CV discrete energy minimization problems. Our contribution is focused on Stereo Matching as a significant CV labeling problem. As a proof of concept, we also use a hybrid quantum-classical solver provided by D-Wave System to compare our results with the best classical inference algorithms in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we introduce a novel spatial pyramid loss that leverages the property of spatio-temporal patch recurrence in a video across the different scales of the video. This loss enhances robustness to unstructured noise in both the spatial and temporal domains. This further results in our framework being highly robust to degradation in input frames and yields state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks such as denoising, object removal, and frame interpolation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct qualitative and quantitative evaluations on standard video datasets such as DAVIS, UCF-101, and VIMEO90K-T.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023; Webpage - http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gauravsh/vdp.html</p></details> |
| **[Mixed Hierarchy Network for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09554v4)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration is a long-standing low-level vision problem, e.g., deblurring and deraining. In the process of image restoration, it is necessary to consider not only the spatial details and contextual information of restoration to ensure the quality, but also the system complexity. Although many methods have been able to guarantee the quality of image restoration, the system complexity of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods is increasing as well. Motivated by this, we present a mixed hierarchy network that can balance these competing goals. Our main proposal is a mixed hierarchy architecture, that progressively recovers contextual information and spatial details from degraded images while we design intra-blocks to reduce system complexity. Specifically, our model first learns the contextual information using encoder-decoder architectures, and then combines them with high-resolution branches that preserve spatial detail. In order to reduce the system complexity of this architecture for convenient analysis and comparison, we replace or remove the nonlinear activation function with multiplication and use a simple network structure. In addition, we replace spatial convolution with global self-attention for the middle block of encoder-decoder. The resulting tightly interlinked hierarchy architecture, named as MHNet, delivers strong performance gains on several image restoration tasks, including image deraining, and deblurring.</p></details> |  |

While existing foundation models have shown exciting potentials on low-level visual tasks, their related abilities are still preliminary and need to be improved. In order to enhance these models, we conduct a large-scale subjective experiment collecting a vast number of real human feedbacks on low-level vision. Each feedback follows a pathway that starts with a detailed description on the low-level visual appearance (*e.g. clarity, color, brightness* of an image, and ends with an overall conclusion, with an average length of 45 words. The constructed **Q-Pathway** dataset includes 58K detailed human feedbacks on 18,973 images with diverse low-level appearance. Moreover, to enable foundation models to robustly respond to diverse types of questions, we design a GPT-participated conversion to process these feedbacks into diverse-format 200K instruction-response pairs. Experimental results indicate that the **Q-Instruct** consistently elevates low-level perception and understanding abilities across several foundational models. We anticipate that our datasets can pave the way for a future that general intelligence can perceive, understand low-level visual appearance and evaluate visual quality like a human.

The effectiveness of grounding representation learning heavily relies on the scale of the training dataset. Despite being a useful data enrichment strategy, data augmentation has received minimal attention in existing vision and language tasks as augmentation for image-caption pairs is non-trivial. In this study, we propose a robust phrase grounding model trained with text-conditioned and text-unconditioned data augmentations. Specifically, we apply text-conditioned color jittering and horizontal flipping to ensure semantic consistency between images and captions. To guarantee image-caption correspondence in the training samples, we modify the captions according to pre-defined keywords when applying horizontal flipping. Additionally, inspired by recent masked signal reconstruction, we propose to use pixel-level masking as a novel form of data augmentation. While we demonstrate our data augmentation method with MDETR framework, the proposed approach is applicable to common grounding-based vision and language tasks with other frameworks. Finally, we show that image encoder pretrained on large-scale image and language datasets (such as CLIP) can further improve the results. Through extensive experiments on three commonly applied datasets: Flickr30k, referring expressions and GQA, our method demonstrates advanced performance over the state-of-the-arts with various metrics.

A prevailing perspective in deep learning encourages using highly complex data for training, with the expectation that richer image background content will facilitate overcoming the generalization problem. However, through comprehensive and systematic experimentation, we discover that this strategy does not enhance the generalization capability of these networks. On the contrary, it exacerbates the tendency of networks to overfit specific degradations. Our experiments reveal that better generalization in a deraining network can be achieved by simplifying the complexity of the training background images. This is because that the networks are ``slacking off'' during training, that is, learning the least complex elements in the image background and degradation to minimize training loss. When the background images are less complex than the rain streaks, the network will prioritize the background reconstruction, thereby suppressing overfitting the rain patterns and leading to improved generalization performance. Our research offers a valuable perspective and methodology for better understanding the generalization problem in low-level vision tasks and displays promising potential for practical application.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches focus on designing specialized schemes to generate image/feature propagation. There is a lack of unified consideration to construct propagative modules, provide theoretical analysis tools, and design effective learning mechanisms. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a unified optimization-inspired learning framework to aggregate Generative, Discriminative, and Corrective (GDC for short) principles with strong generalization for diverse optimization models. Specifically, by introducing a general energy minimization model and formulating its descent direction from different viewpoints (i.e., in a generative manner, based on the discriminative metric and with optimality-based correction), we construct three propagative modules to effectively solve the optimization models with flexible combinations. We design two control mechanisms that provide the non-trivial theoretical guarantees for both fully- and partially-defined optimization formulations. Under the support of theoretical guarantees, we can introduce diverse architecture augmentation strategies such as normalization and search to ensure stable propagation with convergence and seamlessly integrate the suitable modules into the propagation respectively. Extensive experiments across varied low-level vision tasks validate the efficacy and adaptability of GDC.

Recently, transformer models emerged as a promising avenue to enhance LDCT image quality. However, the success of such models relies on a large amount of paired noisy and clean images, which are often scarce in clinical settings. In the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, masked autoencoders (MAE) have been recognized as an effective label-free self-pretraining method for transformers, due to their exceptional feature representation ability. However, the original pretraining and fine-tuning design fails to work in low-level vision tasks like denoising. In response to this challenge, we redesign the classical encoder-decoder learning model and facilitate a simple yet effective low-level vision MAE, referred to as LoMAE, tailored to address the LDCT denoising problem. Moreover, we introduce an MAE-GradCAM method to shed light on the latent learning mechanisms of the MAE/LoMAE. Additionally, we explore the LoMAE's robustness and generability across a variety of noise levels. Experiments results show that the proposed LoMAE can enhance the transformer's denoising performance and greatly relieve the dependence on the ground truth clean data. It also demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalizability over a spectrum of noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual MAE for Image Manipulation Localization: A High-level Vision Learner Focusing on Low-level Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06525v1)** | 2023-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, multimedia forensics faces unprecedented challenges due to the rapid advancement of multimedia generation technology thereby making Image Manipulation Localization (IML) crucial in the pursuit of truth. The key to IML lies in revealing the artifacts or inconsistencies between the tampered and authentic areas, which are evident under pixel-level features. Consequently, existing studies treat IML as a low-level vision task, focusing on allocating tampered masks by crafting pixel-level features such as image RGB noises, edge signals, or high-frequency features. However, in practice, tampering commonly occurs at the object level, and different classes of objects have varying likelihoods of becoming targets of tampering. Therefore, object semantics are also vital in identifying the tampered areas in addition to pixel-level features. This necessitates IML models to carry out a semantic understanding of the entire image. In this paper, we reformulate the IML task as a high-level vision task that greatly benefits from low-level features. Based on such an interpretation, we propose a method to enhance the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) by incorporating high-resolution inputs and a perceptual loss supervision module, which is termed Perceptual MAE (PMAE). While MAE has demonstrated an impressive understanding of object semantics, PMAE can also compensate for low-level semantics with our proposed enhancements. Evidenced by extensive experiments, this paradigm effectively unites the low-level and high-level features of the IML task and outperforms state-of-the-art tampering localization methods on all five publicly available datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Frame Interpolation in Wavelet Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03508v2)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video frame interpolation is an important low-level vision task, which can increase frame rate for more fluent visual experience. Existing methods have achieved great success by employing advanced motion models and synthesis networks. However, the spatial redundancy when synthesizing the target frame has not been fully explored, that can result in lots of inefficient computation. On the other hand, the computation compression degree in frame interpolation is highly dependent on both texture distribution and scene motion, which demands to understand the spatial-temporal information of each input frame pair for a better compression degree selection. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage frame interpolation framework termed WaveletVFI to address above problems. It first estimates intermediate optical flow with a lightweight motion perception network, and then a wavelet synthesis network uses flow aligned context features to predict multi-scale wavelet coefficients with sparse convolution for efficient target frame reconstruction, where the sparse valid masks that control computation in each scale are determined by a crucial threshold ratio. Instead of setting a fixed value like previous methods, we find that embedding a classifier in the motion perception network to learn a dynamic threshold for each sample can achieve more computation reduction with almost no loss of accuracy. On the common high resolution and animation frame interpolation benchmarks, proposed WaveletVFI can reduce computation up to 40% while maintaining similar accuracy, making it perform more efficiently against other state-of-the-arts.

| **[Compound Attention and Neighbor Matching Network for Multi-contrast MRI Super-resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02148v3)** | 2023-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reflects information about human tissue from different perspectives and has many clinical applications. By utilizing the complementary information among different modalities, multi-contrast super-resolution (SR) of MRI can achieve better results than single-image super-resolution. However, existing methods of multi-contrast MRI SR have the following shortcomings that may limit their performance: First, existing methods either simply concatenate the reference and degraded features or exploit global feature-matching between them, which are unsuitable for multi-contrast MRI SR. Second, although many recent methods employ transformers to capture long-range dependencies in the spatial dimension, they neglect that self-attention in the channel dimension is also important for low-level vision tasks. To address these shortcomings, we proposed a novel network architecture with compound-attention and neighbor matching (CANM-Net) for multi-contrast MRI SR: The compound self-attention mechanism effectively captures the dependencies in both spatial and channel dimension; the neighborhood-based feature-matching modules are exploited to match degraded features and adjacent reference features and then fuse them to obtain the high-quality images. We conduct experiments of SR tasks on the IXI, fastMRI, and real-world scanning datasets. The CANM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both retrospective and prospective experiments. Moreover, the robustness study in our work shows that the CANM-Net still achieves good performance when the reference and degraded images are imperfectly registered, proving good potential in clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Generalization Ability of Super-Resolution Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07019v2)** | 2023-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance and generalization ability are two important aspects to evaluate the deep learning models. However, research on the generalization ability of Super-Resolution (SR) networks is currently absent. Assessing the generalization ability of deep models not only helps us to understand their intrinsic mechanisms, but also allows us to quantitatively measure their applicability boundaries, which is important for unrestricted real-world applications. To this end, we make the first attempt to propose a Generalization Assessment Index for SR networks, namely SRGA. SRGA exploits the statistical characteristics of the internal features of deep networks to measure the generalization ability. Specially, it is a non-parametric and non-learning metric. To better validate our method, we collect a patch-based image evaluation set (PIES) that includes both synthetic and real-world images, covering a wide range of degradations. With SRGA and PIES dataset, we benchmark existing SR models on the generalization ability. This work provides insights and tools for future research on model generalization in low-level vision.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |
