| **[Zooming In on Fakes: A Novel Dataset for Localized AI-Generated Image Detection with Forgery Amplification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11922v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI-generated image editing tools has made localized forgeries increasingly realistic, posing challenges for visual content integrity. Although recent efforts have explored localized AIGC detection, existing datasets predominantly focus on object-level forgeries while overlooking broader scene edits in regions such as sky or ground. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000 locally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on semantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed through a fully automated Perception-Creation-Evaluation pipeline to ensure semantic coherence and visual realism. In addition, we further propose \textbf{NFA-ViT}, a Noise-guided Forgery Amplification Vision Transformer that enhances the detection of localized forgeries by amplifying forgery-related features across the entire image. NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in images, \emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints. Subsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction between normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the generalization traces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a broader context and improving overall detection robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BR-Gen constructs entirely new scenarios that are not covered by existing methods. Take a step further, NFA-ViT outperforms existing methods on BR-Gen and generalizes well across current benchmarks.

| **[Affordance-Aware Object Insertion via Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14462v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a common image editing operation, image composition involves integrating foreground objects into background scenes. In this paper, we expand the application of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition tasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the complex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask. By explicitly modeling the insertion mask in the diffusion process, MADD effectively facilitates the notion of affordance. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization performance on in-the-wild images.

| **[CrowdGenUI: Aligning LLM-Based UI Generation with Crowdsourced User Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03477v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across various design domains, including user interface (UI) generation. However, current LLMs for UI generation tend to offer generic solutions that lack a nuanced understanding of task context and user preferences. We present CrowdGenUI, a framework that enhances LLM-based UI generation with crowdsourced user preferences. This framework addresses the limitations by guiding LLM reasoning with real user preferences, enabling the generation of UI widgets that reflect user needs and task-specific requirements. We evaluate our framework in the image editing domain by collecting a library of 720 user preferences from 50 participants, covering preferences such as predictability, efficiency, and explorability of various UI widgets. A user study (N=78) demonstrates that UIs generated with our preference-guided framework can better match user intentions compared to those generated by LLMs alone, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further discuss the study findings and present insights for future research on LLM-based user-centered UI generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MP-Mat: A 3D-and-Instance-Aware Human Matting and Editing Framework with Multiplane Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14606v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human instance matting aims to estimate an alpha matte for each human instance in an image, which is challenging as it easily fails in complex cases requiring disentangling mingled pixels belonging to multiple instances along hairy and thin boundary structures. In this work, we address this by introducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with multiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two different perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically, we first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into multiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene representation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting instances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and boundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce another multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level perspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color. We also treat background as a special instance, which is often overlooked by existing methods. Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and background content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like image editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize controllable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive experiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task. We also demonstrate its superiority in image editing tasks, an area under-explored by existing matting-focused methods, where our approach under zero-shot inference even outperforms trained specialized image editing techniques by large margins.

| **[Visual Prompting for One-shot Controllable Video Editing without Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14335v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot controllable video editing (OCVE) is an important yet challenging task, aiming to propagate user edits that are made -- using any image editing tool -- on the first frame of a video to all subsequent frames, while ensuring content consistency between edited frames and source frames. To achieve this, prior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent noise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the user-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM inversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from accurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content consistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel perspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency models that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence of content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the source frames. Moreover, we introduce a temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across the edited frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | accepted by cvpr2025 |
