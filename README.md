| **[Causality and "In-the-Wild" Video-Based Person Re-ID: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20540v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world deployments despite impressive benchmark performance. Most existing models rely on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures. In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness, interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption. Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Person Re-Identification: A Systematic Survey of Challenges and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06057v2)** | 2021-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been a significant research topic in the past decade due to its real-world applications and research significance. While supervised person Re-ID methods achieve superior performance over unsupervised counterparts, they can not scale to large unlabelled datasets and new domains due to the prohibitive labelling cost. Therefore, unsupervised person Re-ID has drawn increasing attention for its potential to address the scalability issue in person Re-ID. Unsupervised person Re-ID is challenging primarily due to lacking identity labels to supervise person feature learning. The corresponding solutions are diverse and complex, with various merits and limitations. Therefore, comprehensive surveys on this topic are essential to summarise challenges and solutions to foster future research. Existing person Re-ID surveys have focused on supervised methods from classifications and applications but lack detailed discussion on how the person Re-ID solutions address the underlying challenges. This survey review recent works on unsupervised person Re-ID from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of highly influential methods considering the four significant challenges in unsupervised person Re-ID: 1) lacking ground-truth identity labels to supervise person feature learning; 2) learning discriminative person features with pseudo-supervision; 3) learning cross-camera invariant person feature, and 4) the domain shift between datasets. We summarise and analyse evaluation results and provide insights on the effectiveness of the solutions. Finally, we discuss open issues and suggest some promising future research directions.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Weakly Supervised Person Re-ID: Differentiable Graphical Learning and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03845v3)** | 2020-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) benefits greatly from the accurate annotations of existing datasets (e.g., CUHK03 [1] and Market-1501 [2]), which are quite expensive because each image in these datasets has to be assigned with a proper label. In this work, we ease the annotation of Re-ID by replacing the accurate annotation with inaccurate annotation, i.e., we group the images into bags in terms of time and assign a bag-level label for each bag. This greatly reduces the annotation effort and leads to the creation of a large-scale Re-ID benchmark called SYSU-30$k$. The new benchmark contains $30k$ individuals, which is about $20$ times larger than CUHK03 ($1.3k$ individuals) and Market-1501 ($1.5k$ individuals), and $30$ times larger than ImageNet ($1k$ categories). It sums up to 29,606,918 images. Learning a Re-ID model with bag-level annotation is called the weakly supervised Re-ID problem. To solve this problem, we introduce a differentiable graphical model to capture the dependencies from all images in a bag and generate a reliable pseudo label for each person image. The pseudo label is further used to supervise the learning of the Re-ID model. When compared with the fully supervised Re-ID models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SYSU-30$k$ and other datasets. The code, dataset, and pretrained model will be available at \url{https://github.com/wanggrun/SYSU-30k}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2020</p></details> |
| **[CANU-ReID: A Conditional Adversarial Network for Unsupervised person Re-IDentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01308v2)** | 2020-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised person re-ID is the task of identifying people on a target data set for which the ID labels are unavailable during training. In this paper, we propose to unify two trends in unsupervised person re-ID: clustering & fine-tuning and adversarial learning. On one side, clustering groups training images into pseudo-ID labels, and uses them to fine-tune the feature extractor. On the other side, adversarial learning is used, inspired by domain adaptation, to match distributions from different domains. Since target data is distributed across different camera viewpoints, we propose to model each camera as an independent domain, and aim to learn domain-independent features. Straightforward adversarial learning yields negative transfer, we thus introduce a conditioning vector to mitigate this undesirable effect. In our framework, the centroid of the cluster to which the visual sample belongs is used as conditioning vector of our conditional adversarial network, where the vector is permutation invariant (clusters ordering does not matter) and its size is independent of the number of clusters. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the use of conditional adversarial networks for unsupervised person re-ID. We evaluate the proposed architecture on top of two state-of-the-art clustering-based unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) methods on four different experimental settings with three different data sets and set the new state-of-the-art performance on all four of them. Our code and model will be made publicly available at https://team.inria.fr/perception/canu-reid/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Person Re-ID: Fantastic Techniques and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05295v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to identify the same person from multiple camera views without the explicit use of facial recognition is receiving commercial and academic interest. The current status-quo solutions are based on attention neural models. In this paper, we propose Attention and CL loss, which is a hybrid of center and Online Soft Mining (OSM) loss added to the attention loss on top of a temporal attention-based neural network. The proposed loss function applied with bag-of-tricks for training surpasses the state of the art on the common person Re-ID datasets, MARS and PRID 2011. Our source code is publicly available on github.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 Pag...</summary><p>2 Page (Student Abstract) accepted in AAAI-20</p></details> |

| **[FlowAlign: Trajectory-Regularized, Inversion-Free Flow-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23145v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bokeh Diffusion: Defocus Blur Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08434v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics - such as depth-of-field via aperture - current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently alters the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations, providing diverse scenes and subjects as well as supervision to learn the separation of image content from lens blur. Central to our framework is our grounded self-attention mechanism, trained on image pairs with different bokeh levels of the same scene, which enables blur strength to be adjusted in both directions while preserving the underlying scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables flexible, lens-like blur control, supports downstream applications such as real image editing via inversion, and generalizes effectively across both Stable Diffusion and FLUX architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://atfortes.github.io/projects/bokeh-diffusion/</p></details> |
| **[AttentionDrag: Exploiting Latent Correlation Knowledge in Pre-trained Diffusion Models for Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13301v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional point-based image editing methods rely on iterative latent optimization or geometric transformations, which are either inefficient in their processing or fail to capture the semantic relationships within the image. These methods often overlook the powerful yet underutilized image editing capabilities inherent in pre-trained diffusion models. In this work, we propose a novel one-step point-based image editing method, named AttentionDrag, which leverages the inherent latent knowledge and feature correlations within pre-trained diffusion models for image editing tasks. This framework enables semantic consistency and high-quality manipulation without the need for extensive re-optimization or retraining. Specifically, we reutilize the latent correlations knowledge learned by the self-attention mechanism in the U-Net module during the DDIM inversion process to automatically identify and adjust relevant image regions, ensuring semantic validity and consistency. Additionally, AttentionDrag adaptively generates masks to guide the editing process, enabling precise and context-aware modifications with friendly interaction. Our results demonstrate a performance that surpasses most state-of-the-art methods with significantly faster speeds, showing a more efficient and semantically coherent solution for point-based image editing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Preservation and Modification: A Region and Semantic Aware Metric for Instruction-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13827v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing, which aims to modify the image faithfully according to the instruction while preserving irrelevant content unchanged, has made significant progress. However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric for assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human evaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from other tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively evaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant regions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new metric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for instruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into editing-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first identify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to assess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and size of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge further assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant regions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding comprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the editing-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image editing approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad applicability. We verify the effectiveness of the BPM metric on comprehensive instruction-editing data, and the results show the highest alignment with human evaluation compared to existing metrics, indicating its efficacy. Code is available at: https://joyli-x.github.io/BPM/</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexBench-Edit: Benchmarking Complex Instruction-Driven Image Editing via Compositional Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12830v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven image editing has achieved remarkable success in following single instructions. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex, multi-step instructions, particularly ``chain'' instructions where operations are interdependent. Current models struggle with these intricate directives, and existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate such capabilities. Specifically, they often overlook multi-instruction and chain-instruction complexities, and common consistency metrics are flawed. To address this, we introduce ComplexBench-Edit, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess model performance on complex, multi-instruction, and chain-dependent image editing tasks. ComplexBench-Edit also features a new vision consistency evaluation method that accurately assesses non-modified regions by excluding edited areas. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based approach that significantly enhances the ability of existing models to follow complex instructions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ComplexBench-Edit's efficacy in differentiating model capabilities and highlight the superior performance of our CoT-based method in handling complex edits. The data and code are released at https://github.com/llllly26/ComplexBench-Edit.</p></details> | 7 Pages |
| **[SphereDrag: Spherical Geometry-Aware Panoramic Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11863v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing. Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT) adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5% relative improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ming-Lite-Uni: Advancements in Unified Architecture for Natural Multimodal Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02471v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Ming-Lite-Uni, an open-source multimodal framework featuring a newly designed unified visual generator and a native multimodal autoregressive model tailored for unifying vision and language. Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of Ming-Lite-Uni and illustrate the impressive fluid nature of its interactive process. All code and model weights are open-sourced to foster further exploration within the community. Notably, this work aligns with concurrent multimodal AI milestones - such as ChatGPT-4o with native image generation updated in March 25, 2025 - underscoring the broader significance of unified models like Ming-Lite-Uni on the path toward AGI. Ming-Lite-Uni is in alpha stage and will soon be further refined.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/inclusionAI/Ming/tree/Ming-Lite-Omni-Preview/Ming-unify</p></details> |

Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vincie2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Identification of Diffusion-based Image Manipulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05466v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Changing facial expressions, gestures, or background details may dramatically alter the meaning conveyed by an image. Notably, recent advances in diffusion models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models. Our code, data and models will be publicly available at https://alex-costanzino.github.io/radar/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://alex-costanzino.github.io/radar/</p></details> |
| **[Edit360: 2D Image Edits to 3D Assets from Any Angle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10507v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications. We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[EditInspector: A Benchmark for Evaluation of Text-Guided Image Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09988v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality. To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both artifact detection and difference caption generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Spatially Varying Material Selection in Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09023v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selection is the first step in many image editing processes, enabling faster and simpler modifications of all pixels sharing a common modality. In this work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over 800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELBO-T2IAlign: A Generic ELBO-Based Method for Calibrating Pixel-level Text-Image Alignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09740v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ByteMorph: Benchmarking Instruction-Guided Image Editing with Non-Rigid Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03107v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Editing images with instructions to reflect non-rigid motions, camera viewpoint shifts, object deformations, human articulations, and complex interactions, poses a challenging yet underexplored problem in computer vision. Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://boese0601.github.io/bytemorph Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/BM-6M Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/BM-Bench Code: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/BM-code Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Boese0601/ByteMorph-Demo</p></details> |
| **[Ming-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Model for Perception and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09344v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.</p></details> | 18 pages,8 figures |
| **[Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Do Concept Replacement Techniques Really Erase Unacceptable Concepts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08991v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models, have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to "erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity. We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboSwap: A GAN-driven Video Diffusion Framework For Unsupervised Robot Arm Swapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08632v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Compressed Tokenizer Can Generate Without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08257v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any generative model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript: 9 pages, 7 figures.

| **[PairEdit: Learning Semantic Variations for Exemplar-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07992v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-guided image editing have achieved notable success by leveraging natural language prompts for fine-grained semantic control. However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

| **[Diffusion Counterfactual Generation with Semantic Abduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07883v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual image generation presents significant challenges, including preserving identity, maintaining perceptual quality, and ensuring faithfulness to an underlying causal model. While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |
| **[DragNeXt: Rethinking Drag-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07611v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drag-Based Image Editing (DBIE), which allows users to manipulate images by directly dragging objects within them, has recently attracted much attention from the community. However, it faces two key challenges: (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}}) current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing approaches. Code will be released on github.</p></details> |  |

Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for computing a diffusion loss and reward losses. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0 on our testing benchmarks, for real/synthetic image editing, where it achieves a best trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%, compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://seed.bytedance.com/tech/seededit</p></details> |
| **[Bootstrapping World Models from Dynamics Models in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06006v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[FADE: Frequency-Aware Diffusion Model Factorization for Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05934v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts. However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| **[Invisible Backdoor Triggers in Image Editing Model via Deep Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04879v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data. We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[HMAR: Efficient Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04421v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule. We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally, HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Image Editing As Programs with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04158v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.</p></details> |  |

Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization.

Traditional methods rely on time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning for subject alignment, while recent zero-shot approaches leverage on-the-fly image prompting, often sacrificing subject alignment. In this paper, we introduce Diptych Prompting, a novel zero-shot approach that reinterprets as an inpainting task with precise subject alignment by leveraging the emergent property of diptych generation in large-scale text-to-image models. Diptych Prompting arranges an incomplete diptych with the reference image in the left panel, and performs text-conditioned inpainting on the right panel. We further prevent unwanted content leakage by removing the background in the reference image and improve fine-grained details in the generated subject by enhancing attention weights between the panels during inpainting. Experimental results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot image prompting methods, resulting in images that are visually preferred by users. Additionally, our method supports not only subject-driven generation but also stylized image generation and subject-driven image editing, demonstrating versatility across diverse image generation applications.

To quantify this gap, we first introduce RefEdit-Bench, a rigorous real-world benchmark rooted in RefCOCO, where even baselines trained on millions of samples perform poorly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce RefEdit -- an instruction-based editing model trained on our scalable synthetic data generation pipeline. Our RefEdit, trained on only 20,000 editing triplets, outperforms the Flux/SD3 model-based baselines trained on millions of data.

| **[DCI: Dual-Conditional Inversion for Boosting Diffusion-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02560v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and editing tasks. Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing, and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks, significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end, we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in generation quality and overall editing performance.</p></details> |  |

However, current image editing largely overlooks multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts, and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit), which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing. To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural alignment and semantic accuracy.

However, these methods often fall short of the speed demands required for real-world and on-device applications due to the costly multi-step inversion and sampling process involved. In response to this, we introduce SwiftEdit, a simple yet highly efficient editing tool that achieve instant text-guided image editing (in 0.23s). The advancement of SwiftEdit lies in its two novel contributions: a one-step inversion framework that enables one-step image reconstruction via inversion and a mask-guided editing technique with our proposed attention rescaling mechanism to perform localized image editing. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftEdit. In particular, SwiftEdit enables instant text-guided image editing, which is extremely faster than previous multi-step methods (at least 50 times faster) while maintain a competitive performance in editing results.

However, these two capabilities remain largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

Conventional diffusion-based methods, as well as recent rectified flow (RF)-based methods, typically reverse synthesis trajectories by gradually adding noise to clean images, during which the noisy latent at the current timestep is used to approximate that at the next timesteps, introducing accumulated drift and degrading reconstruction accuracy. Considering the fact that in RF the noisy latent is estimated through direct interpolation between Gaussian noises and clean images at each timestep, we propose Direct Noise Alignment (DNA), which directly refines the desired Gaussian noise in the noise domain, significantly reducing the error accumulation in previous methods. Specifically, DNA estimates the velocity field of the interpolated noised latent at each timestep and adjusts the Gaussian noise by computing the difference between the predicted and expected velocity field. We validate the effectiveness of DNA and reveal its relationship with existing RF-based inversion methods. Additionally, we introduce a Mobile Velocity Guidance (MVG) to control the target prompt-guided generation process, balancing image background preservation and target object editability. DNA and MVG collectively constitute our proposed method, namely DNAEdit. Finally, we introduce DNA-Bench, a long-prompt benchmark, to evaluate the performance of advanced image editing models. Experimental results demonstrate that our DNAEdit achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods.

We present $\textbf{LayerCraft}$, a modular framework that uses large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents to orchestrate structured, layered image generation and editing. LayerCraft supports two key capabilities: (1) $\textit{structured generation}$ from simple prompts via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, enabling it to decompose scenes, reason about object placement, and guide composition in a controllable, interpretable manner; and (2) $\textit{layered object integration}$, allowing users to insert and customize objects -- such as characters or props -- across diverse images or scenes while preserving identity, context, and style. The system comprises a coordinator agent, the $\textbf{ChainArchitect}$ for CoT-driven layout planning, and the $\textbf{Object Integration Network (OIN)}$ for seamless image editing using off-the-shelf T2I models without retraining. Through applications like batch collage editing and narrative scene generation, LayerCraft empowers non-experts to iteratively design, customize, and refine visual content with minimal manual effort.

However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens. Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature detection.

However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrojanEdit: Multimodal Backdoor Attack Against Image Editing Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14681v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal diffusion models for image editing generate outputs conditioned on both textual instructions and visual inputs, aiming to modify target regions while preserving the rest of the image. Although diffusion models have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, existing efforts mainly focus on unimodal generative models and fail to address the unique challenges in multimodal image editing. In this paper, we present the first study of backdoor attacks on multimodal diffusion-based image editing models. We investigate the use of both textual and visual triggers to embed a backdoor that achieves high attack success rates while maintaining the model's normal functionality. However, we identify a critical modality bias. Simply combining triggers from different modalities leads the model to primarily rely on the stronger one, often the visual modality, which results in a loss of multimodal behavior and degrades editing quality. To overcome this issue, we propose TrojanEdit, a backdoor injection framework that dynamically adjusts the gradient contributions of each modality during training. This allows the model to learn a truly multimodal backdoor that activates only when both triggers are present. Extensive experiments on multiple image editing models show that TrojanEdit successfully integrates triggers from different modalities, achieving balanced multimodal backdoor learning while preserving clean editing performance and ensuring high attack effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, edits requiring significant structural changes, such as non-rigid deformations, object modifications, or content generation, remain challenging. Existing few step editing approaches produce artifacts such as irrelevant texture or struggle to preserve key attributes of the source image (e.g., pose). We introduce Cora, a novel editing framework that addresses these limitations by introducing correspondence-aware noise correction and interpolated attention maps. Our method aligns textures and structures between the source and target images through semantic correspondence, enabling accurate texture transfer while generating new content when necessary. Cora offers control over the balance between content generation and preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, quantitatively and qualitatively, Cora excels in maintaining structure, textures, and identity across diverse edits, including pose changes, object addition, and texture refinements.

LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to baselines. By eliminating retraining and external constraints, LoRAShop turns personalized diffusion models into a practical `photoshop-with-LoRAs' tool and opens new avenues for compositional visual storytelling and rapid creative iteration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://lorashop.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Weakly-supervised Localization of Manipulated Image Regions Using Multi-resolution Learned Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23586v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of digital images and the widespread availability of image editing tools have made image manipulation detection an increasingly critical challenge. Current deep learning-based manipulation detection methods excel in achieving high image-level classification accuracy, they often fall short in terms of interpretability and localization of manipulated regions. Additionally, the absence of pixel-wise annotations in real-world scenarios limits the existing fully-supervised manipulation localization techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that integrates activation maps generated by image-level manipulation detection networks with segmentation maps from pre-trained models. Specifically, we build on our previous image-level work named WCBnet to produce multi-view feature maps which are subsequently fused for coarse localization. These coarse maps are then refined using detailed segmented regional information provided by pre-trained segmentation models (such as DeepLab, SegmentAnything and PSPnet), with Bayesian inference employed to enhance the manipulation localization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the feasibility to localize image manipulations without relying on pixel-level labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the British Machine Vision Conference 2024 workshop on Media authenticity in the age of artificial intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Aligning Text to Image in Diffusion Models is Easier Than You Think](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08250v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Some approaches address this issue by fine-tuning models in terms of preference optimization, etc., which require tailored datasets. Orthogonal to these methods, we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages existing dataset as both positive and negative pairs. To enable efficient alignment with pretrained models, we propose SoftREPA- a lightweight contrastive fine-tuning strategy that leverages soft text tokens for representation alignment. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.</p></details> |  |

To address this critical trade-off, we introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with 17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast. Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise, instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites: https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1 and https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-E1.

To address this challenge, we introduce and evaluate Imago Obscura, an AI-powered, image-editing copilot that enables users to identify and mitigate privacy risks with images they intend to share. Driven by design requirements from a formative user study with 7 image-editing experts, Imago Obscura enables users to articulate their image-sharing intent and privacy concerns. The system uses these inputs to surface contextually pertinent privacy risks, and then recommends and facilitates application of a suite of obfuscation techniques found to be effective in prior literature -- e.g., inpainting, blurring, and generative content replacement. We evaluated Imago Obscura with 15 end-users in a lab study and found that it greatly improved users' awareness of image privacy risks and their ability to address those risks, allowing them to make more informed sharing decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages including appendix, 14 images, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unforgettable Lessons from Forgettable Images: Intra-Class Memorability Matters in Computer Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20761v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce intra-class memorability, where certain images within the same class are more memorable than others despite shared category characteristics. To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstGenIE: Generative Image Editing Made Efficient with Mask-aware Caching and Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20600v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative image editing using diffusion models has become a prevalent application in today's AI cloud services. In production environments, image editing typically involves a mask that specifies the regions of an image template to be edited. The use of masks provides direct control over the editing process and introduces sparsity in the model inference. In this paper, we present InstGenIE, a system that efficiently serves image editing requests. The key insight behind InstGenIE is that image editing only modifies the masked regions of image templates while preserving the original content in the unmasked areas. Driven by this insight, InstGenIE judiciously skips redundant computations associated with the unmasked areas by reusing cached intermediate activations from previous inferences. To mitigate the high cache loading overhead, InstGenIE employs a bubble-free pipeline scheme that overlaps computation with cache loading. Additionally, to reduce queuing latency in online serving while improving the GPU utilization, InstGenIE proposes a novel continuous batching strategy for diffusion model serving, allowing newly arrived requests to join the running batch in just one step of denoising computation, without waiting for the entire batch to complete. As heterogeneous masks induce imbalanced loads, InstGenIE also develops a load balancing strategy that takes into account the loads of both computation and cache loading. Collectively, InstGenIE outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion serving systems for image editing, achieving up to 3x higher throughput and reducing average request latency by up to 14.7x while ensuring image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Changed? Detecting and Evaluating Instruction-Guided Image Edits with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20405v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing models offer increased personalization opportunities in generative tasks. However, properly evaluating their results is challenging, and most of the existing metrics lag in terms of alignment with human judgment and explainability. To tackle these issues, we introduce DICE (DIfference Coherence Estimator), a model designed to detect localized differences between the original and the edited image and to assess their relevance to the given modification request. DICE consists of two key components: a difference detector and a coherence estimator, both built on an autoregressive Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and trained using a strategy that leverages self-supervision, distillation from inpainting networks, and full supervision. Through extensive experiments, we evaluate each stage of our pipeline, comparing different MLLMs within the proposed framework. We demonstrate that DICE effectively identifies coherent edits, effectively evaluating images generated by different editing models with a strong correlation with human judgment. We publicly release our source code, models, and data.</p></details> |  |

However, open-source image-editing models still lag behind their proprietary counterparts, primarily due to limited high-quality data and insufficient benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ImgEdit, a large-scale, high-quality image-editing dataset comprising 1.2 million carefully curated edit pairs, which contain both novel and complex single-turn edits, as well as challenging multi-turn tasks. To ensure the data quality, we employ a multi-stage pipeline that integrates a cutting-edge vision-language model, a detection model, a segmentation model, alongside task-specific in-painting procedures and strict post-processing. ImgEdit surpasses existing datasets in both task novelty and data quality. Using ImgEdit, we train ImgEdit-E1, an editing model using Vision Language Model to process the reference image and editing prompt, which outperforms existing open-source models on multiple tasks, highlighting the value of ImgEdit and model design. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ImgEdit-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate image editing performance in terms of instruction adherence, editing quality, and detail preservation. It includes a basic testsuite, a challenging single-turn suite, and a dedicated multi-turn suite. We evaluate both open-source and proprietary models, as well as ImgEdit-E1, providing deep analysis and actionable insights into the current behavior of image-editing models.

| **[Efficient Training-Free High-Resolution Synthesis with Energy Rectification in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02537v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress across various visual generation tasks. However, their performance significantly declines when generating content at resolutions higher than those used during training. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enable high-resolution generation, they all suffer from inefficiency. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, a straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution synthesis. Specifically, we propose a noise refresh strategy that unlocks the model's training-free high-resolution synthesis capability and improves efficiency. Additionally, we are the first to observe the phenomenon of energy decay, which may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution synthesis process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and find that tuning the classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly improve generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and demonstrates efficient performance. Furthermore, we show that RectifiedHR is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as image editing, customized generation, and video synthesis. Extensive comparisons with numerous baseline methods validate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of RectifiedHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhenyangcs.github.io/RectifiedHR-Diffusion/</p></details> |

However, complex tasks such as style-aligned text-to-image generation present significant challenges, particularly in data acquisition. In analogy to instruction-following tuning for image editing of AR models, style-aligned generation requires a reference style image and prompt, resulting in a text-image-to-image triplet where the output shares the style and semantics of the input. However, acquiring large volumes of such triplet data with specific styles is considerably more challenging than obtaining conventional text-to-image data used for training generative models. To address this issue, we propose StyleAR, an innovative approach that combines a specially designed data curation method with our proposed AR models to effectively utilize text-to-image binary data for style-aligned text-to-image generation. Our method synthesizes target stylized data using a reference style image and prompt, but only incorporates the target stylized image as the image modality to create high-quality binary data. To facilitate binary data training, we introduce a CLIP image encoder with a perceiver resampler that translates the image input into style tokens aligned with multimodal tokens in AR models and implement a style-enhanced token technique to prevent content leakage which is a common issue in previous work. Furthermore, we mix raw images drawn from large-scale text-image datasets with stylized images to enhance StyleAR's ability to extract richer stylistic features and ensure style consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our superior performance.</p></details> |  |

One potential approach is to utilize Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as an AI agent to build a self-correction framework. However, these approaches are highly dependent on the capabilities of the employed MLLM, often failing to account for all objects within the image. To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, decomposing the self-correction task into object-level subtasks according to three critical dimensions: counting, attributes, and spatial relationships. We construct a multi-agent self-correcting system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Generative AI Capabilities in Everyday Image Editing Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16181v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25, 2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits more than human edits.

| **[Beyond Editing Pairs: Fine-Grained Instructional Image Editing via Multi-Scale Learnable Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19352v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text-driven image editing methods typically follow one of two directions: relying on large-scale, high-quality editing pair datasets to improve editing precision and diversity, or exploring alternative dataset-free techniques. However, constructing large-scale editing datasets requires carefully designed pipelines, is time-consuming, and often results in unrealistic samples or unwanted artifacts. Meanwhile, dataset-free methods may suffer from limited instruction comprehension and restricted editing capabilities. Faced with these challenges, the present work develops a novel paradigm for instruction-driven image editing that leverages widely available and enormous text-image pairs, instead of relying on editing pair datasets. Our approach introduces a multi-scale learnable region to localize and guide the editing process. By treating the alignment between images and their textual descriptions as supervision and learning to generate task-specific editing regions, our method achieves high-fidelity, precise, and instruction-consistent image editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach attains state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and benchmarks, while exhibiting strong adaptability to various types of generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIND-Edit: MLLM Insight-Driven Editing via Language-Vision Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19149v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have significantly accelerated image editing techniques, driving increasing demand for diverse and fine-grained edits. Despite these advances, existing image editing methods still face challenges in achieving high precision and semantic accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent studies address this issue by incorporating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into image editing pipelines. However, current MLLM-based methods mainly rely on interpreting textual instructions, leaving the intrinsic visual understanding of large models largely unexplored, thus resulting in insufficient alignment between textual semantics and visual outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose MIND-Edit, an end-to-end image-editing framework integrating pretrained diffusion model with MLLM. MIND-Edit introduces two complementary strategies: (1) a text instruction optimization strategy that clarifies ambiguous user instructions based on semantic reasoning from the MLLM, and (2) an MLLM insight-driven editing strategy that explicitly leverages the intrinsic visual understanding capability of the MLLM to infer editing intent and guide the diffusion process via generated visual embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a joint training approach to effectively integrate both strategies, allowing them to reinforce each other for more accurate instruction interpretation and visually coherent edits aligned with user intent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art image editing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly under complex and challenging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Affective Image Editing: Shaping Emotional Factors via Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18699v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In daily life, images as common affective stimuli have widespread applications. Despite significant progress in text-driven image editing, there is limited work focusing on understanding users' emotional requests. In this paper, we introduce AIEdiT for Affective Image Editing using Text descriptions, which evokes specific emotions by adaptively shaping multiple emotional factors across the entire images. To represent universal emotional priors, we build the continuous emotional spectrum and extract nuanced emotional requests. To manipulate emotional factors, we design the emotional mapper to translate visually-abstract emotional requests to visually-concrete semantic representations. To ensure that editing results evoke specific emotions, we introduce an MLLM to supervise the model training. During inference, we strategically distort visual elements and subsequently shape corresponding emotional factors to edit images according to users' instructions. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale dataset that includes the emotion-aligned text and image pair set for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AIEdiT achieves superior performance, effectively reflecting users' emotional requests.</p></details> |  |

Immiscible Diffusion recently showed that reducing diffusion trajectory mixing in the noise space via linear assignment accelerates training by simplifying denoising. To extend immiscible diffusion beyond the inefficient linear assignment under high batch sizes and high dimensions, we refine this concept to a broader miscibility reduction at any layer and by any implementation. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the bijective nature of the denoising process with respect to immiscible diffusion, ensuring its preservation of generative diversity. Moreover, we provide thorough analysis and show step-by-step how immiscibility eases denoising and improves efficiency. Extending beyond linear assignment, we propose a family of implementations including K-nearest neighbor (KNN) noise selection and image scaling to reduce miscibility, achieving up to >4x faster training across diverse models and tasks including unconditional/conditional generation, image editing, and robotics planning. Furthermore, our analysis of immiscibility offers a novel perspective on how optimal transport (OT) enhances diffusion training. By identifying trajectory miscibility as a fundamental bottleneck, we believe this work establishes a potentially new direction for future research into high-efficiency diffusion training.

Traditional IDC methods often rely on specialist models, which restrict their applicability across varied contexts. This paper introduces the OneDiff model, a novel generalist approach that utilizes a robust vision-language model architecture, integrating a siamese image encoder with a Visual Delta Module. This innovative configuration allows for the precise detection and articulation of fine-grained differences between image pairs. OneDiff is trained through a dual-phase strategy, encompassing Coupled Sample Training and multi-task learning across a diverse array of data types, supported by our newly developed DiffCap Dataset. This dataset merges real-world and synthetic data, enhancing the training process and bolstering the model's robustness. Extensive testing on diverse IDC benchmarks, such as Spot-the-Diff, Image-Editing-Request, and Birds-to-Words, shows that OneDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in accuracy and adaptability, achieving improvements of up to 97% CIDEr points in average. By setting a new benchmark in IDC, OneDiff paves the way for more versatile and effective applications in detecting and describing visual differences. The code, models, and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches focus on balancing global information from two modalities and encode the query into a unified feature for retrieval. However, due to insufficient attention to fine-grained details, these coarse fusion methods often struggle with handling subtle visual alterations or intricate textual instructions. In this work, we propose DetailFusion, a novel dual-branch framework that effectively coordinates information across global and detailed granularities, thereby enabling detail-enhanced CIR. Our approach leverages atomic detail variation priors derived from an image editing dataset, supplemented by a detail-oriented optimization strategy to develop a Detail-oriented Inference Branch. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Feature Compositor that dynamically fuses global and detailed features based on fine-grained information of each unique multimodal query. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses not only demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CIRR and FashionIQ datasets but also validate the effectiveness and cross-domain adaptability of detail enhancement for CIR.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://dongzhang89.github.io/RGenie.github.io/</p></details> |

However, while these models produce visually plausible outputs, their capacity for knowledge-based reasoning editing tasks remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce KRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed lens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks across three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. Based on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning dimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To support fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that incorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints and calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art models reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need for knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent image editing systems.</p></details> | 39 pages, 36 figures |

However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3) No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets, significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.</p></details> | 14pages,15 figures |

To bridge this gap, we introduce, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed for complex instruction-guided image editing. CompBench features challenging editing scenarios that incorporate fine-grained instruction following, spatial and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling comprehensive evaluation of image editing models' precise manipulation capabilities. To construct CompBench, We propose an MLLM-human collaborative framework with tailored task pipelines. Furthermore, we propose an instruction decoupling strategy that disentangles editing intents into four key dimensions: location, appearance, dynamics, and objects, ensuring closer alignment between instructions and complex editing requirements. Extensive evaluations reveal that CompBench exposes fundamental limitations of current image editing models and provides critical insights for the development of next-generation instruction-guided image editing systems.

Traditional methods optimize the input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes, prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and computational efficiency for drag-based image editing. The Codes of DragLoRA are available at: https://github.com/Sylvie-X/DragLoRA.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

Our method leverages diffusion inversion and timestep-specific null-text embeddings to preserve the structural integrity of the source image. By introducing a stage-wise latent injection strategy-shape injection in early steps and attribute injection in later steps-we enable precise, fine-grained modifications while maintaining global consistency. Cross-attention with reference latents facilitates semantic alignment between the source and reference. Extensive experiments across expression transfer, texture transformation, and style infusion demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, confirming the method's scalability and adaptability to diverse image editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Edit: Detecting and Localizing Edits in Images Altered by Text-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11753v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts. While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics. This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.</p></details> | CVPR (XAI4CV) 2025 |

Existing evaluation approaches often rely on image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii) image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames, we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in realistic image manipulation.

However, these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically specialize on a single editing task. We introduce a versatile, generative workflow that operates in an intrinsic-image latent space, enabling semantic, local manipulation with pixel precision for a range of editing operations. Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal, global relighting, and their combinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025 Journal track</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, code available at https://guillermogotre.github.io/sage/</p></details> |

Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDE-Edit: Masked Dual-Editing for Multi-Object Image Editing via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05101v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1) Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment, leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality, offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> |

Remarkably, these models can achieve this even with a small number of training samples despite a large image dimension, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by leveraging key empirical observations: (i) the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data, (ii) a union of manifold structure of image data, and (iii) the low-rank property of the denoising autoencoder in trained diffusion models. These observations motivate us to assume the underlying data distribution of image data as a mixture of low-rank Gaussians and to parameterize the denoising autoencoder as a low-rank model according to the score function of the assumed distribution. With these setups, we rigorously show that optimizing the training loss of diffusion models is equivalent to solving the canonical subspace clustering problem over the training samples. Based on this equivalence, we further show that the minimal number of samples required to learn the underlying distribution scales linearly with the intrinsic dimensions under the above data and model assumptions. This insight sheds light on why diffusion models can break the curse of dimensionality and exhibit the phase transition in learning distributions. Moreover, we empirically establish a correspondence between the subspaces and the semantic representations of image data, facilitating image editing. We validate these results with corroborated experimental results on both simulated distributions and image datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level. Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation process. Our method achieves an 18.02\% improvement in sentence accuracy over the state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while simultaneously reducing the text-region Fr\'echet inception distance by 53.28\%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Prior scene layout generation methods are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn in image editing applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing image editing methods primarily focus on achieving the desired modifications in a single step, which often struggles with ambiguous user intent, complex transformations, or the need for progressive refinements. As a result, these methods frequently produce inconsistent outcomes or fail to meet user expectations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-turn image editing framework that enables users to iteratively refine their edits, progressively achieving more satisfactory results. Our approach leverages flow matching for accurate image inversion and a dual-objective Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) for stable sampling, effectively mitigating error accumulation. Additionally, by analyzing the layer-wise roles of transformers, we introduce a adaptive attention highlighting method that enhances editability while preserving multi-turn coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves edit success rates and visual fidelity compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, our approach integrates VSSMs within the proposed architecture, enabling high-quality image inversion and flexible editing with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that MambaStyle achieves a superior balance among inversion accuracy, editing quality, and computational efficiency. Notably, our method achieves superior inversion and editing results with reduced model complexity and faster inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation.

HumanEdit bridges this gap by employing human annotators to construct data pairs and administrators to provide feedback.

However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>WebPa...</summary><p>WebPage available at https://liyaowei-stu.github.io/project/BrushEdit/</p></details> |

Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses. In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads. Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Current editing approaches, primarily designed for single-object modifications, struggle with sequential editing: especially with maintaining previous edits along with adapting new objects naturally into the existing content. These limitations significantly hinder complex editing scenarios where multiple objects need to be modified while preserving their contextual relationships. We address this fundamental challenge through two key proposals: enabling rough mask inputs that preserve existing content while naturally integrating new elements and supporting consistent editing across multiple modifications. Our framework achieves this through layer-wise memory, which stores latent representations and prompt embeddings from previous edits. We propose Background Consistency Guidance that leverages memorized latents to maintain scene coherence and Multi-Query Disentanglement in cross-attention that ensures natural adaptation to existing content. To evaluate our method, we present a new benchmark dataset incorporating semantic alignment metrics and interactive editing scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance in iterative image editing tasks with minimal user effort, requiring only rough masks while maintaining high-quality results throughout multiple editing steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond.

Providing a large-scale benchmark set covering a wide range of editing tasks, it allows reliable evaluation, not limited to specific easy-to-evaluate cases. Also, HATIE provides a fully-automated and omnidirectional evaluation pipeline. Particularly, we combine multiple scores measuring various aspects of editing so as to align with human perception.

| **[InstructAttribute: Fine-grained Object Attributes editing with Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00751v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, renowned for their advanced generative abilities, are extensively utilized in image editing applications, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness. However, achieving precise control over fine-grained attributes still presents considerable challenges. Existing image editing techniques either fail to modify the attributes of an object or struggle to preserve its structure and maintain consistency in other areas of the image. To address these challenges, we propose the Structure-Preserving and Attribute Amplification (SPAA), a training-free method which enables precise control over the color and material transformations of objects by editing the self-attention maps and cross-attention values. Furthermore, we constructed the Attribute Dataset, which encompasses nearly all colors and materials associated with various objects, by integrating multimodal large language models (MLLM) to develop an automated pipeline for data filtering and instruction labeling. Training on this dataset, we present our InstructAttribute, an instruction-based model designed to facilitate fine-grained editing of color and material attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in object-level color and material editing, outperforming existing instruction-based image editing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixelHacker: Image Inpainting with Structural and Semantic Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20438v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting is a fundamental research area between image editing and image generation. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have explored novel attention mechanisms, lightweight architectures, and context-aware modeling, demonstrating impressive performance. However, they often struggle with complex structure (e.g., texture, shape, spatial relations) and semantics (e.g., color consistency, object restoration, and logical correctness), leading to artifacts and inappropriate generation. To address this challenge, we design a simple yet effective inpainting paradigm called latent categories guidance, and further propose a diffusion-based model named PixelHacker. Specifically, we first construct a large dataset containing 14 million image-mask pairs by annotating foreground and background (potential 116 and 21 categories, respectively). Then, we encode potential foreground and background representations separately through two fixed-size embeddings, and intermittently inject these features into the denoising process via linear attention. Finally, by pre-training on our dataset and fine-tuning on open-source benchmarks, we obtain PixelHacker. Extensive experiments show that PixelHacker comprehensively outperforms the SOTA on a wide range of datasets (Places2, CelebA-HQ, and FFHQ) and exhibits remarkable consistency in both structure and semantics.

| **[ColorEdit: Training-free Image-Guided Color editing with diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10232v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, with their impressive generative capabilities, have been adopted for image editing tasks, demonstrating remarkable efficacy. However, due to attention leakage and collision between the cross-attention map of the object and the new color attribute from the text prompt, text-guided image editing methods may fail to change the color of an object, resulting in a misalignment between the resulting image and the text prompt. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the process of text-guided image synthesizing and what semantic information different cross-attention blocks have learned. We observe that the visual representation of an object is determined in the up-block of the diffusion model in the early stage of the denoising process, and color adjustment can be achieved through value matrices alignment in the cross-attention layer. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward, yet stable, and effective image-guided method to modify the color of an object without requiring any additional fine-tuning or training. Lastly, we present a benchmark dataset called COLORBENCH, the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of color change methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in object-level color editing and surpass the performance of popular text-guided image editing approaches in both synthesized and real images.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning methods demand significant computational resources and large datasets, while training-free techniques struggle with instruction comprehension and edit quality. We resolve this dilemma by leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformer (DiT)' enhanced generation capacity and native contextual awareness. Our solution introduces three contributions: (1) an in-context editing framework for zero-shot instruction compliance using in-context prompting, avoiding structural changes; (2) a LoRA-MoE hybrid tuning strategy that enhances flexibility with efficient adaptation and dynamic expert routing, without extensive retraining; and (3) an early filter inference-time scaling method using vision-language models (VLMs) to select better initial noise early, improving edit quality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's superiority: it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring only 0.5% training data and 1% trainable parameters compared to conventional baselines. This work establishes a new paradigm that enables high-precision yet efficient instruction-guided editing.

Despite excelling in academic benchmarks, they have yet to be widely adopted for real user needs. Datasets that power these models use artificial edits, lacking the scale and ecological validity necessary to address the true diversity of user requests. We introduce REALEDIT, a large-scale image editing dataset with authentic user requests and human-made edits sourced from Reddit. REALEDIT includes a test set of 9300 examples to evaluate models on real user requests. Our results show that existing models fall short on these tasks, highlighting the need for realistic training data. To address this, we introduce 48K training examples and train our REALEDIT model, achieving substantial gains - outperforming competitors by up to 165 Elo points in human judgment and 92 percent relative improvement on the automated VIEScore metric. We deploy our model on Reddit, testing it on new requests, and receive positive feedback. Beyond image editing, we explore REALEDIT's potential in detecting edited images by partnering with a deepfake detection non-profit. Finetuning their model on REALEDIT data improves its F1-score by 14 percentage points, underscoring the dataset's value for broad applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, these methods remain far from practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio, limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we present \omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in four folds: (1) \omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o) instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle any image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of different aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different tasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that \omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models. Our code, dataset and model will be available at https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/OmniEdit/</p></details> | 21 pages |

Generated conditionally from real images and textual prompts, these edits are often imperceptible to both humans and existing detection systems, revealing significant limitations in current defenses. We propose a novel multimodal capsule network, CapsFake, designed to detect such deepfake image edits by integrating low-level capsules from visual, textual, and frequency-domain modalities. High-level capsules, predicted through a competitive routing mechanism, dynamically aggregate local features to identify manipulated regions with precision. Evaluated on diverse datasets, including MagicBrush, Unsplash Edits, Open Images Edits, and Multi-turn Edits, CapsFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 20% in detection accuracy. Ablation studies validate its robustness, achieving detection rates above 94% under natural perturbations and 96% against adversarial attacks, with excellent generalization to unseen editing scenarios. This approach establishes a powerful framework for countering sophisticated image manipulations.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages,11 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

When trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing: users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and precise edit operations. We hope that this work will serve as a benchmark for the newly introduced task of multi-method image editing.

| **[DCT-Shield: A Robust Frequency Domain Defense against Malicious Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17894v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in diffusion models have enabled effortless image editing via text prompts, raising concerns about image security. Attackers with access to user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Fields: Uncovering Hierarchical Feature Control for StyleGAN via Inverted Receptive Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17712v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>StyleGAN has demonstrated the ability of GANs to synthesize highly-realistic faces of imaginary people from random noise. One limitation of GAN-based image generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space. Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its application. This paper introduces the concept of "generative fields" to explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at synthesis time.</p></details> |  |

It presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures. Under review</p></details> |

Due to the high cost of annotation and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jahawn-Wen/CAMeL-reID.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset. The TVPReid dataset will be publicly available to benefit future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia</p></details> |

Prior works leverage pre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully fine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements compared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model is prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method for Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the multi-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously integrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and Adapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information with task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust global feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are optimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix is proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation of prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla prefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer normalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts caused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art results across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\% parameters.

Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures |

Tailoring CLIP to person domain is now a emerging research topic due to the abundant knowledge of vision-language pretraining, but challenges still remain during fine-tuning: (i) Previous full-model fine-tuning in TPR is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.(ii) Existing parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for TPR lacks of fine-grained feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose Domain-Aware Mixture-of-Adapters (DM-Adapter), which unifies Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and PETL to enhance fine-grained feature representations while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, Sparse Mixture-of-Adapters is designed in parallel to MLP layers in both vision and language branches, where different experts specialize in distinct aspects of person knowledge to handle features more finely. To promote the router to exploit domain information effectively and alleviate the routing imbalance, Domain-Aware Router is then developed by building a novel gating function and injecting learnable domain-aware prompts. Extensive experiments show that our DM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-path Exploration and Feedback Adjustment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21318v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to identify the specific persons using textual descriptions as queries. Existing ad vanced methods typically depend on vision-language pre trained (VLP) models to facilitate effective cross-modal alignment. However, the inherent constraints of VLP mod-els, which include the global alignment biases and insuffi-cient self-feedback regulation, impede optimal retrieval per formance. In this paper, we propose MeFa, a Multi-Pathway Exploration, Feedback, and Adjustment framework, which deeply explores intrinsic feedback of intra and inter-modal to make targeted adjustment, thereby achieving more precise person-text associations. Specifically, we first design an intra modal reasoning pathway that generates hard negative sam ples for cross-modal data, leveraging feedback from these samples to refine intra-modal reasoning, thereby enhancing sensitivity to subtle discrepancies. Subsequently, we intro duce a cross-modal refinement pathway that utilizes both global information and intermodal feedback to refine local in formation, thus enhancing its global semantic representation. Finally, the discriminative clue correction pathway incorpo rates fine-grained features of secondary similarity as discrim inative clues to further mitigate retrieval failures caused by disparities in these features. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that MeFa achieves superior person retrieval performance without necessitating additional data or complex structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beat: Bi-directional One-to-Many Embedding Alignment for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05620v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval (TPR) is a challenging task that involves retrieving a specific individual based on a textual description. Despite considerable efforts to bridge the gap between vision and language, the significant differences between these modalities continue to pose a challenge. Previous methods have attempted to align text and image samples in a modal-shared space, but they face uncertainties in optimization directions due to the movable features of both modalities and the failure to account for one-to-many relationships of image-text pairs in TPR datasets. To address this issue, we propose an effective bi-directional one-to-many embedding paradigm that offers a clear optimization direction for each sample, thus mitigating the optimization problem. Additionally, this embedding scheme generates multiple features for each sample without introducing trainable parameters, making it easier to align with several positive samples. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel Bi-directional one-to-many Embedding Alignment (Beat) model to address the TPR task. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Beat model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular TPR datasets, including CUHK-PEDES (65.61 R@1), ICFG-PEDES (58.25 R@1), and RSTPReID (48.10 R@1). Furthermore, additional experiments on MS-COCO, CUB, and Flowers datasets further demonstrate the potential of Beat to be applied to other image-text retrieval tasks.</p></details> | ACM MM2023 |

This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem, we contribute a new benchmark named \textbf{UFineBench} for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly, we construct a new \textbf{dataset} named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions, averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation, we also propose a special \textbf{evaluation paradigm} more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains, cross textual granularity and cross textual styles, named UFine3C, and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability, named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover, we propose CFAM, a more efficient \textbf{algorithm} especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation, CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets, especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore, by evaluating on UFine3C, we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets.

It supports multimodal tasks, including text-based person retrieval and human matching. One of the most significant challenges faced in Re-ID is clothes-changing, where the same person may appear in different outfits. While previous methods have made notable progress in maintaining clothing data consistency and handling clothing change data, they still rely excessively on clothing information, which can limit performance due to the dynamic nature of human appearances. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Pose-Guidance Deep Supervision (PGDS), an effective framework for learning pose guidance within the Re-ID task. It consists of three modules: a human encoder, a pose encoder, and a Pose-to-Human Projection module (PHP). Our framework guides the human encoder, i.e., the main re-identification model, with pose information from the pose encoder through multiple layers via the knowledge transfer mechanism from the PHP module, helping the human encoder learn body parts information without increasing computation resources in the inference stage. Through extensive experiments, our method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness for real-world applications.

The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training. However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets. This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR. LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information. In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training. LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR models. Comprehensive experiments on three TPR benchmarks show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models.</p></details> |  |

To close the gap, we study the problem of text-based person search in full images by proposing a new end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimize the pedestrian detection, identification and visual-semantic feature embedding tasks. To take full advantage of the query text, the semantic features are leveraged to instruct the Region Proposal Network to pay more attention to the text-described proposals. Besides, a cross-scale visual-semantic embedding mechanism is utilized to improve the performance. To validate the proposed method, we collect and annotate two large-scale benchmark datasets based on the widely adopted image-based person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets and compared with the baseline methods, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge lies in bridging the substantial gap between vision and language modalities, especially when dealing with limited large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a CLIP-based Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (CSKT) approach for TPR. Specifically, to explore the CLIP's knowledge on input side, we first propose a Bidirectional Prompts Transferring (BPT) module constructed by text-to-image and image-to-text bidirectional prompts and coupling projections. Secondly, Dual Adapters Transferring (DAT) is designed to transfer knowledge on output side of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in vision and language. This synergistic two-way collaborative mechanism promotes the early-stage feature fusion and efficiently exploits the existing knowledge of CLIP. CSKT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across three benchmark datasets when the training parameters merely account for 7.4% of the entire model, demonstrating its remarkable efficiency, effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP2024(accepted). minor typos revision compared to version 1 in arxiv</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset named PRW-TPS-CN based on the widely used person search dataset PRW. Our dataset contains 47,102 sentences, which means there is quite more information than existing dataset. These texts precisely describe the person images from top to bottom, which in line with the natural description order. We also provide both Chinese and English descriptions in our dataset for more comprehensive evaluation. These characteristics make our dataset more applicable. To alleviate the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval, we take advantage of the rich texts in PRW-TPS-CN dataset. We propose to aggregate multiple texts as text prototypes to maintain the prominent text features of a person, which can better reflect the whole character of a person. The overall prototypes lead to generating the image attention map to eliminate the detection misalignment causing the decrease of text-based person retrieval. Thus, the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval is largely alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments on the PRW-TPS-CN dataset. The experimental results show the PRW-TPS-CN dataset's effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

In particular, MALS contains 1,510,330 image-text pairs, which is about 37.5 times larger than prevailing CUHK-PEDES, and all images are annotated with 27 attributes. Considering the privacy concerns and annotation costs, we leverage the off-the-shelf diffusion models to generate the dataset. To verify the feasibility of learning from the generated data, we develop a new joint Attribute Prompt Learning and Text Matching Learning (APTM) framework, considering the shared knowledge between attribute and text. As the name implies, APTM contains an attribute prompt learning stream and a text matching learning stream. (1) The attribute prompt learning leverages the attribute prompts for image-attribute alignment, which enhances the text matching learning. (2) The text matching learning facilitates the representation learning on fine-grained details, and in turn, boosts the attribute prompt learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the pre-training on MALS, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance via APTM on three challenging real-world benchmarks. In particular, APTM achieves a consistent improvement of +6.96%, +7.68%, and +16.95% Recall@1 accuracy on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets by a clear margin, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Many previous approaches contrive to learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a \textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When mapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common manifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely invisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus so as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal common manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of the actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal data can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we propose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common Manifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our method, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\textit{san si er hou xing}', namely, to \textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping mechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to CDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the visual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality into C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on two text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05773</p></details> |

Existing methods generally face a \textbf{color over-reliance problem}, which means that the models rely heavily on color information when matching cross-modal data. Indeed, color information is an important decision-making accordance for retrieval, but the over-reliance on color would distract the model from other key clues (e.g. texture information, structural information, etc.), and thereby lead to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to \textbf{C}apture \textbf{A}ll-round \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}eyond \textbf{C}olor (\textbf{CAIBC}) via a jointly optimized multi-branch architecture for text-based person retrieval. CAIBC contains three branches including an RGB branch, a grayscale (GRS) branch and a color (CLR) branch. Besides, with the aim of making full use of all-round information in a balanced and effective way, a mutual learning mechanism is employed to enable the three branches which attend to varied aspects of information to communicate with and learn from each other. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to evaluate our proposed CAIBC method on the CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets in both \textbf{supervised} and \textbf{weakly supervised} text-based person retrieval settings, which demonstrates that CAIBC significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all the three tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22</p></details> |

The key is to learn a common latent space mapping between visual-textual modalities. To achieve this goal, existing works employ segmentation to obtain explicitly cross-modal alignments or utilize attention to explore salient alignments. These methods have two shortcomings: 1) Labeling cross-modal alignments are time-consuming. 2) Attention methods can explore salient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs. To relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT) framework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT utilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which contributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained alignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms: multi-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA module explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the BMM module aims to mine \textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and textual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES. Even without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of high-dimensional data, the unconstrained mapping paradigms are not able to properly catch discriminative clues about the corresponding person while drop the misaligned information. Intuitively, the information contained in visual data can be divided into person information (PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each other. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person information, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A surroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to realize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a mutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and multi-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse alignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only accessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES. To properly evaluate our proposed DSSL in the real scenarios, a Real Scenarios Text-based Person Reidentification (RSTPReid) dataset is constructed to benefit future research on text-based person retrieval, which will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'21</p></details> |

In this paper we propose a person retrieval system that uses textual queries (e.g., "black trousers and green shirt") as descriptions and a one-class generative color model with outlier filtering to represent the images both to train the models and to perform the search. The method is evaluated in terms of its efficiency in fulfilling the needs of a forensic retrieval system: limited annotation, robustness, extensibility, adaptability and computational cost. The proposed generative method is compared to a corresponding discriminative approach. Experiments are carried out using a range of queries in three different databases. The experiments show that the two evaluated algorithms provide average retrieval performance and adaptable to new datasets. The proposed generative algorithm has some advantages over the discriminative one, specifically its capability to work with very few training samples and its much lower computational requirements when the number of training examples increases.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multiple Information Prompt Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00330v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification is a subject closer to the real world, which focuses on solving the problem of person re-identification after pedestrians change clothes. The primary challenge in this field is to overcome the complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to identify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient data collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this problem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice. Current methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the original image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely limited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional model. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel multiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person ReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance of multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS) module is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB image features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The Bio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning intensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP) module is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the impact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID, Celeb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%, 66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively. When compared to AIM (CVPR23), ACID (TIP23), and SCNet (MM23), MIPL achieves rank-1 improvements of 11.3%, 13.8%, and 7.9%, respectively, on the PRCC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Clothes Changing Person ReID: Conflicts, Synthesis, and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12611v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same person wearing different outfits. Mainstream researches focus on designing advanced model structures and strategies to capture identity information independent of clothing. However, the same-clothes discrimination as the standard ReID learning objective in CC-ReID is persistently ignored in previous researches. In this study, we dive into the relationship between standard and clothes-changing~(CC) learning objectives, and bring the inner conflicts between these two objectives to the fore. We try to magnify the proportion of CC training pairs by supplementing high-fidelity clothes-varying synthesis, produced by our proposed Clothes-Changing Diffusion model. By incorporating the synthetic images into CC-ReID model training, we observe a significant improvement under CC protocol. However, such improvement sacrifices the performance under the standard protocol, caused by the inner conflict between standard and CC. For conflict mitigation, we decouple these objectives and re-formulate CC-ReID learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. By effectively regularizing the gradient curvature across multiple objectives and introducing preference restrictions, our MOO solution surpasses the single-task training paradigm. Our framework is model-agnostic, and demonstrates superior performance under both CC and standard ReID protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEFF: Improving Any Clothes-Changing Person ReID Model using Gallery Enrichment with Face Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13807v2)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) problem, given a query sample of a person, the goal is to determine the correct identity based on a labeled gallery in which the person appears in different clothes. Several models tackle this challenge by extracting clothes-independent features. However, the performance of these models is still lower for the clothes-changing setting compared to the same-clothes setting in which the person appears with the same clothes in the labeled gallery. As clothing-related features are often dominant features in the data, we propose a new process we call Gallery Enrichment, to utilize these features. In this process, we enrich the original gallery by adding to it query samples based on their face features, using an unsupervised algorithm. Additionally, we show that combining ReID and face feature extraction modules alongside an enriched gallery results in a more accurate ReID model, even for query samples with new outfits that do not include faces. Moreover, we claim that existing CC-ReID benchmarks do not fully represent real-world scenarios, and propose a new video CC-ReID dataset called 42Street, based on a theater play that includes crowded scenes and numerous clothes changes. When applied to multiple ReID models, our method (GEFF) achieves an average improvement of 33.5% and 6.7% in the Top-1 clothes-changing metric on the PRCC and LTCC benchmarks. Combined with the latest ReID models, our method achieves new SOTA results on the PRCC, LTCC, CCVID, LaST and VC-Clothes benchmarks and the proposed 42Street dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08387v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2108.04527</p></details> |
| **[Identity-Guided Collaborative Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04400v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information), cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised clothing change adaptive person ReID](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03702v2)** | 2021-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothing changes and lack of data labels are both crucial challenges in person ReID. For the former challenge, people may occur multiple times at different locations wearing different clothing. However, most of the current person ReID research works focus on the benchmarks in which a person's clothing is kept the same all the time. For the last challenge, some researchers try to make model learn information from a labeled dataset as a source to an unlabeled dataset. Whereas purely unsupervised training is less used. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems at the same time. We design a novel unsupervised model, Sync-Person-Cloud ReID, to solve the unsupervised clothing change person ReID problem. We developer a purely unsupervised clothing change person ReID pipeline with person sync augmentation operation and same person feature restriction. The person sync augmentation is to supply additional same person resources. These same person's resources can be used as part supervised input by same person feature restriction. The extensive experiments on clothing change ReID datasets show the out-performance of our methods.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Multigranular Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04527v1)** | 2021-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail. To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task, but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme (MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic information that is used to align the human attributes.</p></details> |  |

| **[Inverse Virtual Try-On: Generating Multi-Category Product-Style Images from Clothed Individuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21062v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF), which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i) difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses, often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the target garments.</p></details> |  |
