| **[Causality and "In-the-Wild" Video-Based Person Re-ID: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20540v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based person re-identification (Re-ID) remains brittle in real-world deployments despite impressive benchmark performance. Most existing models rely on superficial correlations such as clothing, background, or lighting that fail to generalize across domains, viewpoints, and temporal variations. This survey examines the emerging role of causal reasoning as a principled alternative to traditional correlation-based approaches in video-based Re-ID. We provide a structured and critical analysis of methods that leverage structural causal models, interventions, and counterfactual reasoning to isolate identity-specific features from confounding factors. The survey is organized around a novel taxonomy of causal Re-ID methods that spans generative disentanglement, domain-invariant modeling, and causal transformers. We review current evaluation metrics and introduce causal-specific robustness measures. In addition, we assess practical challenges of scalability, fairness, interpretability, and privacy that must be addressed for real-world adoption. Finally, we identify open problems and outline future research directions that integrate causal modeling with efficient architectures and self-supervised learning. This survey aims to establish a coherent foundation for causal video-based person Re-ID and to catalyze the next phase of research in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | 30 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Person Re-Identification: A Systematic Survey of Challenges and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06057v2)** | 2021-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been a significant research topic in the past decade due to its real-world applications and research significance. While supervised person Re-ID methods achieve superior performance over unsupervised counterparts, they can not scale to large unlabelled datasets and new domains due to the prohibitive labelling cost. Therefore, unsupervised person Re-ID has drawn increasing attention for its potential to address the scalability issue in person Re-ID. Unsupervised person Re-ID is challenging primarily due to lacking identity labels to supervise person feature learning. The corresponding solutions are diverse and complex, with various merits and limitations. Therefore, comprehensive surveys on this topic are essential to summarise challenges and solutions to foster future research. Existing person Re-ID surveys have focused on supervised methods from classifications and applications but lack detailed discussion on how the person Re-ID solutions address the underlying challenges. This survey review recent works on unsupervised person Re-ID from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of highly influential methods considering the four significant challenges in unsupervised person Re-ID: 1) lacking ground-truth identity labels to supervise person feature learning; 2) learning discriminative person features with pseudo-supervision; 3) learning cross-camera invariant person feature, and 4) the domain shift between datasets. We summarise and analyse evaluation results and provide insights on the effectiveness of the solutions. Finally, we discuss open issues and suggest some promising future research directions.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Weakly Supervised Person Re-ID: Differentiable Graphical Learning and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03845v3)** | 2020-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) benefits greatly from the accurate annotations of existing datasets (e.g., CUHK03 [1] and Market-1501 [2]), which are quite expensive because each image in these datasets has to be assigned with a proper label. In this work, we ease the annotation of Re-ID by replacing the accurate annotation with inaccurate annotation, i.e., we group the images into bags in terms of time and assign a bag-level label for each bag. This greatly reduces the annotation effort and leads to the creation of a large-scale Re-ID benchmark called SYSU-30$k$. The new benchmark contains $30k$ individuals, which is about $20$ times larger than CUHK03 ($1.3k$ individuals) and Market-1501 ($1.5k$ individuals), and $30$ times larger than ImageNet ($1k$ categories). It sums up to 29,606,918 images. Learning a Re-ID model with bag-level annotation is called the weakly supervised Re-ID problem. To solve this problem, we introduce a differentiable graphical model to capture the dependencies from all images in a bag and generate a reliable pseudo label for each person image. The pseudo label is further used to supervise the learning of the Re-ID model. When compared with the fully supervised Re-ID models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SYSU-30$k$ and other datasets. The code, dataset, and pretrained model will be available at \url{https://github.com/wanggrun/SYSU-30k}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2020</p></details> |
| **[CANU-ReID: A Conditional Adversarial Network for Unsupervised person Re-IDentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01308v2)** | 2020-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised person re-ID is the task of identifying people on a target data set for which the ID labels are unavailable during training. In this paper, we propose to unify two trends in unsupervised person re-ID: clustering & fine-tuning and adversarial learning. On one side, clustering groups training images into pseudo-ID labels, and uses them to fine-tune the feature extractor. On the other side, adversarial learning is used, inspired by domain adaptation, to match distributions from different domains. Since target data is distributed across different camera viewpoints, we propose to model each camera as an independent domain, and aim to learn domain-independent features. Straightforward adversarial learning yields negative transfer, we thus introduce a conditioning vector to mitigate this undesirable effect. In our framework, the centroid of the cluster to which the visual sample belongs is used as conditioning vector of our conditional adversarial network, where the vector is permutation invariant (clusters ordering does not matter) and its size is independent of the number of clusters. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the use of conditional adversarial networks for unsupervised person re-ID. We evaluate the proposed architecture on top of two state-of-the-art clustering-based unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) methods on four different experimental settings with three different data sets and set the new state-of-the-art performance on all four of them. Our code and model will be made publicly available at https://team.inria.fr/perception/canu-reid/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Person Re-ID: Fantastic Techniques and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05295v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to identify the same person from multiple camera views without the explicit use of facial recognition is receiving commercial and academic interest. The current status-quo solutions are based on attention neural models. In this paper, we propose Attention and CL loss, which is a hybrid of center and Online Soft Mining (OSM) loss added to the attention loss on top of a temporal attention-based neural network. The proposed loss function applied with bag-of-tricks for training surpasses the state of the art on the common person Re-ID datasets, MARS and PRID 2011. Our source code is publicly available on github.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 Pag...</summary><p>2 Page (Student Abstract) accepted in AAAI-20</p></details> |

| **[Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively. Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG) demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details, code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech Report, 23 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[ADCD-Net: Robust Document Image Forgery Localization via Adaptive DCT Feature and Hierarchical Content Disentanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16397v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of sensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image forgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been extensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered regions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and structured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack sufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their practical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery localization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and integrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the DCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT feature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much improved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping. Also, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the localization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore, noticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a pristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually enhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net demonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\% averaged over 5 types of distortions. The code is available at https://github.com/KAHIMWONG/ACDC-Net.</p></details> |  |
| **[Make Me Happier: Evoking Emotions Through Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08255v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress in image generation, emotional image editing remains under-explored. The semantics, context, and structure of an image can evoke emotional responses, making emotional image editing techniques valuable for various real-world applications, including treatment of psychological disorders, commercialization of products, and artistic design. First, we present a novel challenge of emotion-evoked image generation, aiming to synthesize images that evoke target emotions while retaining the semantics and structures of the original scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a diffusion model capable of effectively understanding and editing source images to convey desired emotions and sentiments. Moreover, due to the lack of emotion editing datasets, we provide a unique dataset consisting of 340,000 pairs of images and their emotion annotations. Furthermore, we conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce a new evaluation metric to systematically benchmark all the methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses all competitive baselines. Our diffusion model is capable of identifying emotional cues from original images, editing images that elicit desired emotions, and meanwhile, preserving the semantic structure of the original images. All code, model, and dataset are available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale Your Instructions: Enhance the Instruction-Following Fidelity of Unified Image Generation Model by Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16240v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have enabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a single framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free form. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly reducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and editing tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers from text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains multiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation analysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the cross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts between neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In response, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that leverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to dynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS enhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training or test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image editing and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of our SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing methods. The code is available https://github.com/zhouchao-ops/SaaS.</p></details> | Accept by ICCV2025 |
| **[LMM4Edit: Benchmarking and Evaluating Multimodal Image Editing with LMMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16193v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) enables image modifications through text prompts. However, current TIE models still struggle to balance image quality, editing alignment, and consistency with the original image, limiting their practical applications. Existing TIE evaluation benchmarks and metrics have limitations on scale or alignment with human perception. To this end, we introduce EBench-18K, the first large-scale image Editing Benchmark including 18K edited images with fine-grained human preference annotations for evaluating TIE. Specifically, EBench-18K includes 1,080 source images with corresponding editing prompts across 21 tasks, 18K+ edited images produced by 17 state-of-the-art TIE models, 55K+ mean opinion scores (MOSs) assessed from three evaluation dimensions, and 18K+ question-answering (QA) pairs. Based on EBench-18K, we employ outstanding LMMs to assess edited images, while the evaluation results, in turn, provide insights into assessing the alignment between the LMMs' understanding ability and human preferences. Then, we propose LMM4Edit, a LMM-based metric for evaluating image Editing models from perceptual quality, editing alignment, attribute preservation, and task-specific QA accuracy in an all-in-one manner. Extensive experiments show that LMM4Edit achieves outstanding performance and aligns well with human preference. Zero-shot validation on the other datasets also shows the generalization ability of our model. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/LMM4Edit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |
| **[PFB-Diff: Progressive Feature Blending Diffusion for Text-driven Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16894v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated their ability to generate diverse and high-quality images, sparking considerable interest in their potential for real image editing applications. However, existing diffusion-based approaches for local image editing often suffer from undesired artifacts due to the latent-level blending of the noised target images and diffusion latent variables, which lack the necessary semantics for maintaining image consistency. To address these issues, we propose PFB-Diff, a Progressive Feature Blending method for Diffusion-based image editing. Unlike previous methods, PFB-Diff seamlessly integrates text-guided generated content into the target image through multi-level feature blending. The rich semantics encoded in deep features and the progressive blending scheme from high to low levels ensure semantic coherence and high quality in edited images. Additionally, we introduce an attention masking mechanism in the cross-attention layers to confine the impact of specific words to desired regions, further improving the performance of background editing and multi-object replacement. PFB-Diff can effectively address various editing tasks, including object/background replacement and object attribute editing. Our method demonstrates its superior performance in terms of editing accuracy and image quality without the need for fine-tuning or training. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CMACH508/PFB-Diff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neural Networks.

This paper proposes a novel, efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference, reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages including appendix, 5 tables, 8 figures, to be submitted to WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[R-Genie: Reasoning-Guided Generative Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17768v2)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent image synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://dongzhang89.github.io/RGenie.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models via Rich Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11720v4)** | 2025-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images, from which we extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Diffusion-RLHF/RPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Weather Synthesis and Removal with Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00704v2)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic and controllable weather effects in videos is valuable for many applications. Physics-based weather simulation requires precise reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects -- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025, Project Website: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/WeatherWeaver/</p></details> |
| **[NoHumansRequired: Autonomous High-Quality Image Editing Triplet Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14119v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction, edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moodifier: MLLM-Enhanced Emotion-Driven Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14024v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes. Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry, and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation approaches often rely on image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii) image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sueqian6.github.io/GIE-Bench-web/</p></details> |

However, existing unified models exhibit limitations in image synthesis quality, autoregressive error accumulation, and image editing capability. In this work, we propose Nexus-Gen, a novel architecture that unifies image understanding, generation, and editing tasks in a shared image embedding space. This shared space serves as a bridge for the autoregressive and diffusion models, which seamlessly integrates their complementary strengths in cross-modal modeling. To mitigate the severe error accumulation during autoregressive embedding prediction, we propose a novel prefilled autoregression strategy that aligns training-inference dynamics by prefilling input sequences with learnable embeddings. After multi-stage and multi-task training on our constructed large-scale dataset with 26.3 million samples, Nexus-Gen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation benchmarks spanning image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and source codes are released in https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen to facilitate further advancements across the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[EditGen: Harnessing Cross-Attention Control for Instruction-Based Auto-Regressive Audio Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11096v1)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we investigate leveraging cross-attention control for efficient audio editing within auto-regressive models. Inspired by image editing methodologies, we develop a Prompt-to-Prompt-like approach that guides edits through cross and self-attention mechanisms. Integrating a diffusion-based strategy, influenced by Auffusion, we extend the model's functionality to support refinement edits, establishing a baseline for prompt-guided audio editing. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach by incorporating MUSICGEN, a pre-trained frozen auto-regressive model, and propose three editing mechanisms, based on Replacement, Reweighting, and Refinement of the attention scores. We employ commonly-used music-specific evaluation metrics and a human study, to gauge time-varying controllability, adherence to global text cues, and overall audio realism. The automatic and human evaluations indicate that the proposed combination of prompt-to-prompt guidance with autoregressive generation models significantly outperforms the diffusion-based baseline in terms of melody, dynamics, and tempo of the generated audio.

| **[Sparse Fine-Tuning of Transformers for Generative Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10855v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained transformers have revolutionized artificial intelligence across various domains, and fine-tuning remains the dominant approach for adapting these models to downstream tasks due to the cost of training from scratch. However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations are formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging to interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new tasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse coding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of basic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms function as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms allows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then serve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each atom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of sparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image editing performance by improving text alignment through the removal of unimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task, where our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse combination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline fine-tuning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Computer Vision 2025</p></details> |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

While prior works often rely on outputs containing technical jargon, LayLens bridges the gap between model reasoning and human understanding through a three-stage pipeline: (1) explainable deepfake detection using a state-of-the-art forgery localization model, (2) natural language simplification of technical explanations using a vision-language model, and (3) visual reconstruction of a plausible original image via guided image editing. The interface presents both technical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side comparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15 participants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity and reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in identifying deepfakes. LayLens offers a step toward transparent, trustworthy, and user-centric deepfake forensics.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high-quality video editing remains a significant challenge. One major hurdle is the absence of open-source, large-scale video editing datasets based on real-world data, as constructing such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Moreover, video data requires a significantly larger number of tokens for representation, which substantially increases the training costs for video editing models. Lastly, current video editing models offer limited interactivity, often making it difficult for users to express their editing requirements effectively in a single attempt. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a dataset VIVID-10M and a baseline model VIVID. VIVID-10M is the first large-scale hybrid image-video local editing dataset aimed at reducing data construction and model training costs, which comprises 9.7M samples that encompass a wide range of video editing tasks. VIVID is a Versatile and Interactive VIdeo local eDiting model trained on VIVID-10M, which supports entity addition, modification, and deletion. At its core, a keyframe-guided interactive video editing mechanism is proposed, enabling users to iteratively edit keyframes and propagate it to other frames, thereby reducing latency in achieving desired outcomes. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video local editing, surpassing baseline methods in both automated metrics and user studies. The VIVID-10M dataset are open-sourced at https://kwaivgi.github.io/VIVID/.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, language instructions alone often fall short in accurately conveying user requirements, particularly when users want to add, replace elements in specific areas of an image. Luckily, masks can effectively indicate the exact locations or elements to be edited, while they require users to precisely draw the shapes at the desired locations, which is highly user-unfriendly. To address this, we propose FlexEdit, an end-to-end image editing method that leverages both free-shape masks and language instructions for Flexible Editing. Our approach employs a VLLM in comprehending the image content, mask, and user instructions. Additionally, we introduce the Mask Enhance Adapter (MEA) that fuses the embeddings of the VLLM with the image data, ensuring a seamless integration of mask information and model output embeddings. Furthermore, we construct FSMI-Edit, a benchmark specifically tailored for free-shape mask, including 8 types of free-shape mask. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in LLM-based image editing, and our simple prompting technique stands out in its effectiveness.

However, there are many issues that could make the composite images unrealistic. These issues can be summarized as the inconsistency between foreground and background, which includes appearance inconsistency (e.g., incompatible illumination), geometry inconsistency (e.g., unreasonable size), and semantic inconsistency (e.g., mismatched semantic context). Image composition task could be decomposed into multiple sub-tasks, in which each sub-task targets at one or more issues. Specifically, object placement aims to find reasonable scale, location, and shape for the foreground. Image blending aims to address the unnatural boundary between foreground and background. Image harmonization aims to adjust the illumination statistics of foreground. Shadow (resp., reflection) generation aims to generate plausible shadow (resp., reflection) for the foreground. These sub-tasks can be executed sequentially or parallelly to acquire realistic composite images. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous survey on image composition (object insertion). In this paper, we conduct comprehensive survey over the sub-tasks and combinatorial task of image composition (object insertion). For each one, we summarize the existing methods, available datasets, and common evaluation metrics. We have also contributed the first image composition toolbox libcom, which assembles 10+ image composition related functions (e.g., image blending, image harmonization, object placement, shadow generation, generative composition). The ultimate goal of this toolbox is solving all the problems related to image composition with simple `import libcom'.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often suffer from a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity. Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD Bench and DragBench.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Spotlight |

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a 0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench, and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43 (+8.98%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we build a large-scale, matting-level semantic segmentation dataset, named MaSS13K, which consists of 13,348 real-world images, all at 4K resolution. MaSS13K provides high-quality mask annotations of a number of objects, which are categorized into seven categories: human, vegetation, ground, sky, water, building, and others. MaSS13K features precise masks, with an average mask complexity 20-50 times higher than existing semantic segmentation datasets. We consequently present a method specifically designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation, namely MaSSFormer, which employs an efficient pixel decoder that aggregates high-level semantic features and low-level texture features across three stages, aiming to produce high-resolution masks with minimal computational cost. Finally, we propose a new learning paradigm, which integrates the high-quality masks of the seven given categories with pseudo labels from new classes, enabling MaSSFormer to transfer its accurate segmentation capability to other classes of objects. Our proposed MaSSFormer is comprehensively evaluated on the MaSS13K benchmark together with 14 representative segmentation models. We expect that our meticulously annotated MaSS13K dataset and the MaSSFormer model can facilitate the research of high-resolution and high-quality semantic segmentation.

However, they often struggle with consistency and object identity preservation due to their inherent pixel-manipulation nature. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel "2D-3D-2D" framework. Our approach begins by lifting 2D objects into 3D representation, enabling edits within a physically plausible, rigidity-constrained 3D environment. The edited 3D objects are then reprojected and seamlessly inpainted back into the original 2D image. In contrast to existing 2D editing methods, such as DragGAN and DragDiffusion, our method directly manipulates objects in a 3D environment. Extensive experiments highlight that our framework surpasses previous methods in general performance, delivering highly consistent edits while robustly preserving object identity.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

To address these challenges, we propose BayesGenie, an off-the-shelf approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization to facilitate precise and user-friendly image editing. Our method enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions without manual area marking, while preserving the original image's semantic integrity. Unlike existing techniques that require extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, our approach demonstrates remarkable adaptability across various LLMs through its model-agnostic design. BayesGenie employs an adapted Bayesian optimization strategy to automatically refine the inference process parameters, achieving high-precision image editing with minimal user intervention. Through extensive experiments across diverse scenarios, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in both editing accuracy and semantic preservation, as validated using different LLMs including Claude3 and GPT-4.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 fig...</summary><p>8 figures, accept at ACL2025 Findings</p></details> |

Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

Moreover, current models frequently suffer from poor identity preservation, unintended edits, or rely heavily on manual masks. To address these challenges, we introduce X-Planner, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based planning system that effectively bridges user intent with editing model capabilities. X-Planner employs chain-of-thought reasoning to systematically decompose complex instructions into simpler, clear sub-instructions. For each sub-instruction, X-Planner automatically generates precise edit types and segmentation masks, eliminating manual intervention and ensuring localized, identity-preserving edits.

However, naive applications of existing methods to editing tasks that require fine-grained control, e.g., face editing, often lead to suboptimal solutions with identity information and high-frequency details lost during the editing process, or irrelevant image regions altered due to entangled concepts. In this work, we propose S$^2$Edit, a novel method based on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model that enables personalized editing with precise semantic and spatial control. We first fine-tune our model to embed the identity information into a learnable text token. During fine-tuning, we disentangle the learned identity token from attributes to be edited by enforcing an orthogonality constraint in the textual feature space. To ensure that the identity token only affects regions of interest, we apply object masks to guide the cross-attention maps. At inference time, our method performs localized editing while faithfully preserving the original identity with semantically disentangled and spatially focused identity token learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$Edit over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we showcase several compositional image editing applications of S$^2$Edit such as makeup transfer.</p></details> |  |

Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM(2025)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Models Learn Low-Dimensional Distributions via Subspace Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02426v4)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that diffusion models can effectively learn the image distribution and generate new samples. Remarkably, these models can achieve this even with a small number of training samples despite a large image dimension, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by leveraging key empirical observations: (i) the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data, (ii) a union of manifold structure of image data, and (iii) the low-rank property of the denoising autoencoder in trained diffusion models. These observations motivate us to assume the underlying data distribution of image data as a mixture of low-rank Gaussians and to parameterize the denoising autoencoder as a low-rank model according to the score function of the assumed distribution. With these setups, we rigorously show that optimizing the training loss of diffusion models is equivalent to solving the canonical subspace clustering problem over the training samples. Based on this equivalence, we further show that the minimal number of samples required to learn the underlying distribution scales linearly with the intrinsic dimensions under the above data and model assumptions. This insight sheds light on why diffusion models can break the curse of dimensionality and exhibit the phase transition in learning distributions. Moreover, we empirically establish a correspondence between the subspaces and the semantic representations of image data, facilitating image editing. We validate these results with corroborated experimental results on both simulated distributions and image datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This results in two critical limitations: I) poor user-defined flexibility (coarse-grained human masks restrict edits to predefined regions like upper torso; fine-grained clothes masks preserve poses but forbid style/length customization). II) weak pose robustness (mask generators fail due to articulated poses and miss rare regions like waist, while human parsers remain limited by predefined categories). To address these gaps, we propose Pose-Star, a framework that dynamically recomposes body structures (e.g., neck, chest, etc.) into anatomy-aware masks (e.g., chest-length) for user-defined edits. In Pose-Star, we calibrate diffusion-derived attention (Star tokens) via skeletal keypoints to enhance rare structure localization in complex poses, suppress noise through phase-aware analysis of attention dynamics (Convergence,Stabilization,Divergence) with threshold masking and sliding-window fusion, and refine edges via cross-self attention merging and Canny alignment. This work bridges controlled benchmarks and open-world demands, pioneering anatomy-aware, pose-robust editing and laying the foundation for industrial fashion image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 17 figures, ICCV25</p></details> |

As a result, these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene, i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting, moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities. Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis, incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks.

We then adapt attention during injection to improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without a source prompt.

Recent works have introduced score distillation techniques that leverage the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models to solve this task without additional fine-tuning. However, these methods often struggle with tasks such as object insertion. Our investigation of these failures reveals significant variations in gradient magnitude and spatial distribution, making hyperparameter tuning highly input-specific or unsuccessful. To address this, we propose two simple yet effective modifications: attention-based spatial regularization and gradient filtering-normalization, both aimed at reducing these variations during gradient updates. Experimental results show our method outperforms state-of-the-art score distillation techniques in prompt fidelity, improving successful edits while preserving the background.

However, the equally important area of remote sensing image (RSI) editing has not received sufficient attention. Deep learning based editing methods generally involve two sequential stages: generation and editing. For natural images, these stages primarily rely on generative backbones pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets and text guidance facilitated by vision-language models (VLMs). However, it become less viable for RSIs: First, existing generative RSI benchmark datasets do not fully capture the diversity of RSIs, and is often inadequate for universal editing tasks. Second, the single text semantic corresponds to multiple image semantics, leading to the introduction of incorrect semantics. To solve above problems, this paper proposes a text-guided RSI editing method and can be trained using only a single image. A multi-scale training approach is adopted to preserve consistency without the need for training on extensive benchmarks, while leveraging RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) to ensure accuracy and controllability. Experimental results on multiple RSI editing tasks show that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both CLIP scores and subjective evaluations compared to existing methods. Additionally, we explore the ability of the edited RSIs to support disaster assessment tasks in order to validate their practicality.

While text-based methods excel at semantic manipulations through textual prompts, they often struggle with precise geometric details (e.g., poses and viewpoint changes). Reference-based editing, on the other hand, typically focuses on style or appearance and fails at non-rigid transformations. By explicitly learning the editing transformation from a source-target pair, Edit Transfer mitigates the limitations of both text-only and appearance-centric references. Drawing inspiration from in-context learning in large language models, we propose a visual relation in-context learning paradigm, building upon a DiT-based text-to-image model. We arrange the edited example and the query image into a unified four-panel composite, then apply lightweight LoRA fine-tuning to capture complex spatial transformations from minimal examples. Despite using only 42 training samples, Edit Transfer substantially outperforms state-of-the-art TIE and RIE methods on diverse non-rigid scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of few-shot visual relation learning.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Unified Framework for Stealthy Adversarial Generation via Latent Optimization and Transferability Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23676v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their powerful image generation capabilities, diffusion-based adversarial example generation methods through image editing are rapidly gaining popularity. However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the "1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications. We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. Among these, watermarking methods capable of preserving the generation quality are receiving increased attention. However, the proliferation and high performance of generative image editing applications have elevated the risks of malicious tampering, creating new demands. 1) The tamper robustness of current lossless visual quality watermarks remains constrained by the modification-sensitive diffusion inversion process, necessitating enhanced robustness. 2) The improved tampering quality and rapid iteration cycles render passive tampering detection methods inadequate, making proactive tampering localization capability a desired feature for watermarks. To address these requirements, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results indicate that TAG-WM achieves SOTA tampering robustness and tampering localization capability with distortions while maintaining lossless generation quality and a considerable capacity of 256 bits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision)</p></details> |

Another challenging problem that how to use the signals such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus, with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

| **[Dense Feature Interaction Network for Image Inpainting Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02191v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting, the process of filling in missing areas in an image, is a common image editing technique. Inpainting can be used to conceal or alter image contents in malicious manipulation of images, driving the need for research in image inpainting detection. Most existing methods use a basic encoder-decoder structure, which often results in a high number of false positives or misses the inpainted regions, especially when dealing with targets of varying semantics and scales. Additionally, the lack of an effective approach to capture boundary artifacts leads to less accurate edge localization. In this paper, we describe a new method for inpainting detection based on a Dense Feature Interaction Network (DeFI-Net). DeFI-Net uses a novel feature pyramid architecture to capture and amplify multi-scale representations across various stages, thereby improving the detection of image inpainting by better strengthening feature-level interactions. Additionally, the network can adaptively direct the lower-level features, which carry edge and shape information, to refine the localization of manipulated regions while integrating the higher-level semantic features. Using DeFI-Net, we develop a method combining complementary representations to accurately identify inpainted areas. Evaluation on seven image inpainting datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting inpainting across diverse models. Code and models are available at https://github.com/Boombb/DeFI-Net_Inpainting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Explainable Bilingual Multimodal Misinformation Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22930v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing realism of multimodal content has made misinformation more subtle and harder to detect, especially in news media where images are frequently paired with bilingual (e.g., Chinese-English) subtitles. Such content often includes localized image edits and cross-lingual inconsistencies that jointly distort meaning while remaining superficially plausible. We introduce BiMi, a bilingual multimodal framework that jointly performs region-level localization, cross-modal and cross-lingual consistency detection, and natural language explanation for misinformation analysis. To support generalization, BiMi integrates an online retrieval module that supplements model reasoning with up-to-date external context. We further release BiMiBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark constructed by systematically editing real news images and subtitles, comprising 104,000 samples with realistic manipulations across visual and linguistic modalities. To enhance interpretability, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve explanation quality, marking the first use of GRPO in this domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiMi outperforms strong baselines by up to +8.9 in classification accuracy, +15.9 in localization accuracy, and +2.5 in explanation BERTScore, advancing state-of-the-art performance in realistic, multilingual misinformation detection. Code, models, and datasets will be released.</p></details> |  |

Diffusion-based image editing approaches capitalized on the deep understanding of diffusion models of image semantics to perform a variety of edits. However, existing diffusion models lack sufficient understanding of many object parts, hindering fine-grained edits requested by users. To address this, we propose to expand the knowledge of pre-trained diffusion models to allow them to understand various object parts, enabling them to perform fine-grained edits. We achieve this by learning special textual tokens that correspond to different object parts through an efficient token optimization process. These tokens are optimized to produce reliable localization masks at each inference step to localize the editing region. Leveraging these masks, we design feature-blending and adaptive thresholding strategies to execute the edits seamlessly. To evaluate our approach, we establish a benchmark and an evaluation protocol for part editing. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing editing methods on all metrics and is preferred by users 66-90% of the time in conducted user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025 (Conference Track).

While base image models struggle with spatial relationships and affordance reasoning, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes this task into structured stages: functional design, symbolic scene graph reasoning, layout synthesis, and local image editing. Specialized agents collaborate through iterative feedback to ensure the scene is visually coherent and functionally solvable. Experiments show that agent collaboration improves output quality in terms of solvability, shortcut avoidance, and affordance clarity, while maintaining visual quality.</p></details> |  |

However, placing objects in an environment with a precise location and orientation still remains a challenge, as this typically requires carefully crafted inpainting masks or prompts. In this work, we show that a carefully designed visual map, combined with coarse object masks, is sufficient for high quality object placement. We design a conditioning signal that resolves ambiguities, while being flexible enough to allow for changing of shapes or object orientations. By building on an inpainting model, we leave the background intact by design, in contrast to methods that model objects and background jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the automotive setting, where we compare different conditioning signals in novel object placement tasks. These tasks are designed to measure edit quality not only in terms of appearance, but also in terms of pose and location accuracy, including cases that require non-trivial shape changes. Lastly, we show that fine location control can be combined with appearance control to place existing objects in precise locations in a scene.</p></details> |  |

Existing image editing methods typically rely on neural networks, which struggle to accurately handle shadows and refractions. Conversely, physics-based inverse rendering often requires multi-view optimization, limiting its practicality in single-image scenarios. In this paper, we propose Materialist, a method combining a learning-based approach with physically based progressive differentiable rendering. Given an image, our method leverages neural networks to predict initial material properties. Progressive differentiable rendering is then used to optimize the environment map and refine the material properties with the goal of closely matching the rendered result to the input image. Our approach enables a range of applications, including material editing, object insertion, and relighting, while also introducing an effective method for editing material transparency without requiring full scene geometry. Furthermore, Our envmap estimation method also achieves state-of-the-art performance, further enhancing the accuracy of image editing task.

| **[Improving Diffusion-Based Image Editing Faithfulness via Guidance and Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21045v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided diffusion models have become essential for high-quality image synthesis, enabling dynamic image editing. In image editing, two crucial aspects are editability, which determines the extent of modification, and faithfulness, which reflects how well unaltered elements are preserved. However, achieving optimal results is challenging because of the inherent trade-off between editability and faithfulness. To address this, we propose Faithfulness Guidance and Scheduling (FGS), which enhances faithfulness with minimal impact on editability. FGS incorporates faithfulness guidance to strengthen the preservation of input image information and introduces a scheduling strategy to resolve misalignment between editability and faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate that FGS achieves superior faithfulness while maintaining editability. Moreover, its compatibility with various editing methods enables precise, high-quality image edits across diverse tasks.</p></details> | preprint |

Deep learning-based methods have recently achieved high accuracy in pixel-level forgery localization, yet they frequently struggle with computational overhead and limited representation power, particularly for subtle or complex tampering. In this paper, we propose M2SFormer, a novel Transformer encoder-based framework designed to overcome these challenges. Unlike approaches that process spatial and frequency cues separately, M2SFormer unifies multi-frequency and multi-scale attentions in the skip connection, harnessing global context to better capture diverse forgery artifacts. Additionally, our framework addresses the loss of fine detail during upsampling by utilizing a global prior map, a curvature metric indicating the difficulty of forgery localization, which then guides a difficulty-guided attention module to preserve subtle manipulations more effectively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that M2SFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, offering superior generalization in detecting and localizing forgeries across unseen domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

Also, remove the cat for a clearer view and recolor the wall to yellow.'' It combines the fast, high-level subtask planning by large language models (LLMs) with the slow, accurate, tool-use, and local A$^*$ search per subtask to find a cost-efficient toolpath -- a sequence of calls to AI tools. To save the cost of A$^*$ on similar subtasks, we perform inductive reasoning on previously successful toolpaths via LLMs to continuously extract/refine frequently used subroutines and reuse them as new tools for future tasks in an adaptive fast-slow planning, where the higher-level subroutines are explored first, and only when they fail, the low-level A$^*$ search is activated. The reusable symbolic subroutines considerably save exploration cost on the same types of subtasks applied to similar images, yielding a human-like fast-slow toolpath agent "FaSTA$^*$'': fast subtask planning followed by rule-based subroutine selection per subtask is attempted by LLMs at first, which is expected to cover most tasks, while slow A$^*$ search is only triggered for novel and challenging subtasks. By comparing with recent image editing approaches, we demonstrate FaSTA$^*$ is significantly more computationally efficient while remaining competitive with the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of success rate.</p></details> |  |

Unlike OmniGen v1, OmniGen2 features two distinct decoding pathways for text and image modalities, utilizing unshared parameters and a decoupled image tokenizer. This design enables OmniGen2 to build upon existing multimodal understanding models without the need to re-adapt VAE inputs, thereby preserving the original text generation capabilities. To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed comprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and in-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism tailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset based on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2 achieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including text-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation, also referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named OmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models in terms of consistency.

These image prompts are used to guide an edit-aware flow in the latent space of a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model, allowing the edit to be coherently propagated across views.

In this work, we tackle exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024 (AI4VA Workshop)</p></details> |

Recent literature builds on a new generation of generative models to synthesize highly realistic images for full-stack simulation. However, purely synthetically generated scenes are not grounded in reality and have difficulty in inspiring confidence in the relevance of its outcomes. Editing models, on the other hand, leverage source scenes from real driving logs, and enable the simulation of different traffic layouts, behaviors, and operating conditions such as weather and time of day. While image editing is an established topic in computer vision, it presents fresh sets of challenges in driving simulation: (1) the need for cross-camera 3D consistency, (2) learning ``empty street" priors from driving data with foreground occlusions, and (3) obtaining paired image tuples of varied editing conditions while preserving consistent layout and geometry. To address these challenges, we propose SceneCrafter, a versatile editor for realistic 3D-consistent manipulation of driving scenes captured from multiple cameras. We build on recent advancements in multi-view diffusion models, using a fully controllable framework that scales seamlessly to multi-modality conditions like weather, time of day, agent boxes and high-definition maps. To generate paired data for supervising the editing model, we propose a novel framework on top of Prompt-to-Prompt to generate geometrically consistent synthetic paired data with global edits. We also introduce an alpha-blending framework to synthesize data with local edits, leveraging a model trained on empty street priors through novel masked training and multi-view repaint paradigm. SceneCrafter demonstrates powerful editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art realism, controllability, 3D consistency, and scene editing quality compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Much literature collects large amounts of annotated image-text pairs to train text-conditioned generative models from scratch, which is expensive and not efficient. After that, some approaches that leverage pre-trained vision-language models have been proposed to avoid data collection, but they are limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. To address these issues, we investigate and identify a specific space, referred to as CLIP DeltaSpace, where the CLIP visual feature difference of two images is semantically aligned with the CLIP textual feature difference of their corresponding text descriptions. Based on DeltaSpace, we propose a novel framework called DeltaEdit, which maps the CLIP visual feature differences to the latent space directions of a generative model during the training phase, and predicts the latent space directions from the CLIP textual feature differences during the inference phase. And this design endows DeltaEdit with two advantages: (1) text-free training; (2) generalization to various text prompts for zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of DeltaEdit with different generative models, including both the GAN model and the diffusion model, in achieving flexible text-guided image editing.

However, these methods are computationally intensive because of their iterative nature. While distilled diffusion models enable faster inference, their editing capabilities remain limited, primarily because of poor inversion quality. High-fidelity inversion and reconstruction are essential for precise image editing, as they preserve the structural and semantic integrity of the source image. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps. Our method introduces a cycle-consistency optimization strategy that significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and enables a controllable trade-off between editability and content preservation.

However, existing AIM approaches rely on rigid \emph{one-to-one} mappings between emotions and visual cues, making them ill-suited for the inherently subjective and diverse ways in which humans perceive and express emotion.To address this, we introduce a novel task setting termed \emph{Diverse AIM (D-AIM)}, aiming to generate multiple visually distinct yet emotionally consistent image edits from a single source image and target emotion. We propose \emph{EmoAgent}, the first multi-agent framework tailored specifically for D-AIM. EmoAgent explicitly decomposes the manipulation process into three specialized phases executed by collaborative agents: a Planning Agent that generates diverse emotional editing strategies, an Editing Agent that precisely executes these strategies, and a Critic Agent that iteratively refines the results to ensure emotional accuracy. This collaborative design empowers EmoAgent to model \emph{one-to-many} emotion-to-visual mappings, enabling semantically diverse and emotionally faithful edits.Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that EmoAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both emotional fidelity and semantic diversity, effectively generating multiple distinct visual edits that convey the same target emotion.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving fine-grained control over specific object attributes, such as color and material, remains a considerable challenge. Existing methods often fail to accurately modify these attributes or compromise structural integrity and overall image consistency. To fill this gap, we introduce Structure Preservation and Attribute Amplification (SPAA), a novel training-free framework that enables precise generation of color and material attributes for the same object by intelligently manipulating self-attention maps and cross-attention values within diffusion models. Building on SPAA, we integrate multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to automate data curation and instruction generation. Leveraging this object attribute data collection engine, we construct the Attribute Dataset, encompassing a comprehensive range of colors and materials across diverse object categories. Using this generated dataset, we propose InstructAttribute, an instruction-tuned model that enables fine-grained and object-level attribute editing through natural language prompts. This capability holds significant practical implications for diverse fields, from accelerating product design and e-commerce visualization to enhancing virtual try-on experiences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructAttribute outperforms existing instruction-based baselines, achieving a superior balance between attribute modification accuracy and structural preservation.</p></details> |  |

The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction.

Existing methods often struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes, textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique. Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing, demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.</p></details> |  |

In theory, the reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed, which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability, that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step is Enough: Sparse Autoencoders for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22366v4)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.</p></details> |  |
| **[FOCUS: Unified Vision-Language Modeling for Interactive Editing Driven by Referential Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16806v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arch-Router: Aligning LLM Routing with Human Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16655v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) -- each optimized for different strengths, style, or latency/cost profile -- routing has become an essential technique to operationalize the use of different models. However, existing LLM routing approaches are limited in two key ways: they evaluate performance using benchmarks that often fail to capture human preferences driven by subjective evaluation criteria, and they typically select from a limited pool of models. In this work, we propose a preference-aligned routing framework that guides model selection by matching queries to user-defined domains (e.g., travel) or action types (e.g., image editing) -- offering a practical mechanism to encode preferences in routing decisions. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Arch-Router}, a compact 1.5B model that learns to map queries to domain-action preferences for model routing decisions. Our approach also supports seamlessly adding new models for routing without requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Experiments on conversational datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in matching queries with human preferences, outperforming top proprietary models. Our approach captures subjective evaluation criteria and makes routing decisions more transparent and flexible. Our model is available at: \texttt{https://huggingface.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B}.</p></details> |  |

Our dataset enables training and evaluation of models that modify vector graphics based on textual commands. We describe the data collection process, including image pairing via CLIP similarity and instruction generation with vision-language models. Initial experiments with state-of-the-art large language models reveal that current methods struggle to produce accurate and valid edits, underscoring the challenge of this task.

| **[Bokeh Diffusion: Defocus Blur Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08434v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics - such as depth-of-field via aperture - current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently alters the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations, providing diverse scenes and subjects as well as supervision to learn the separation of image content from lens blur. Central to our framework is our grounded self-attention mechanism, trained on image pairs with different bokeh levels of the same scene, which enables blur strength to be adjusted in both directions while preserving the underlying scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables flexible, lens-like blur control, supports downstream applications such as real image editing via inversion, and generalizes effectively across both Stable Diffusion and FLUX architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://atfortes.github.io/projects/bokeh-diffusion/</p></details> |

These methods often overlook the powerful yet underutilized image editing capabilities inherent in pre-trained diffusion models. In this work, we propose a novel one-step point-based image editing method, named AttentionDrag, which leverages the inherent latent knowledge and feature correlations within pre-trained diffusion models for image editing tasks. This framework enables semantic consistency and high-quality manipulation without the need for extensive re-optimization or retraining. Specifically, we reutilize the latent correlations knowledge learned by the self-attention mechanism in the U-Net module during the DDIM inversion process to automatically identify and adjust relevant image regions, ensuring semantic validity and consistency. Additionally, AttentionDrag adaptively generates masks to guide the editing process, enabling precise and context-aware modifications with friendly interaction. Our results demonstrate a performance that surpasses most state-of-the-art methods with significantly faster speeds, showing a more efficient and semantically coherent solution for point-based image editing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balancing Preservation and Modification: A Region and Semantic Aware Metric for Instruction-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13827v1)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing, which aims to modify the image faithfully according to the instruction while preserving irrelevant content unchanged, has made significant progress. However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric for assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human evaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from other tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively evaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant regions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new metric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for instruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into editing-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first identify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to assess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and size of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge further assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant regions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding comprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the editing-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image editing approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad applicability. We verify the effectiveness of the BPM metric on comprehensive instruction-editing data, and the results show the highest alignment with human evaluation compared to existing metrics, indicating its efficacy. Code is available at: https://joyli-x.github.io/BPM/</p></details> |  |

However, real-world scenarios often involve complex, multi-step instructions, particularly ``chain'' instructions where operations are interdependent. Current models struggle with these intricate directives, and existing benchmarks inadequately evaluate such capabilities. Specifically, they often overlook multi-instruction and chain-instruction complexities, and common consistency metrics are flawed. To address this, we introduce ComplexBench-Edit, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess model performance on complex, multi-instruction, and chain-dependent image editing tasks. ComplexBench-Edit also features a new vision consistency evaluation method that accurately assesses non-modified regions by excluding edited areas. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based approach that significantly enhances the ability of existing models to follow complex instructions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ComplexBench-Edit's efficacy in differentiating model capabilities and highlight the superior performance of our CoT-based method in handling complex edits.

Due to their spherical geometry and projection distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing. Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT) adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5% relative improvement.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of Ming-Lite-Uni and illustrate the impressive fluid nature of its interactive process. All code and model weights are open-sourced to foster further exploration within the community. Notably, this work aligns with concurrent multimodal AI milestones - such as ChatGPT-4o with native image generation updated in March 25, 2025 - underscoring the broader significance of unified models like Ming-Lite-Uni on the path toward AGI.

Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vincie2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Notably, recent advances in diffusion models greatly improve the quality of image manipulation while also opening the door to misuse. Identifying changes made to authentic images, thus, becomes an important task, constantly challenged by new diffusion-based editing tools. To this end, we propose a novel approach for ReliAble iDentification of inpainted AReas (RADAR). RADAR builds on existing foundation models and combines features from different image modalities. It also incorporates an auxiliary contrastive loss that helps to isolate manipulated image patches. We demonstrate these techniques to significantly improve both the accuracy of our method and its generalisation to a large number of diffusion models. To support realistic evaluation, we further introduce BBC-PAIR, a new comprehensive benchmark, with images tampered by 28 diffusion models. Our experiments show that RADAR achieves excellent results, outperforming the state-of-the-art in detecting and localising image edits made by both seen and unseen diffusion models.

This trend highlights the need for a comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality. To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both artifact detection and difference caption generation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a method for material selection in images, robust to lighting and reflectance variations, which can be used for downstream editing tasks. We rely on vision transformer (ViT) models and leverage their features for selection, proposing a multi-resolution processing strategy that yields finer and more stable selection results than prior methods. Furthermore, we enable selection at two levels: texture and subtexture, leveraging a new two-level material selection (DuMaS) dataset which includes dense annotations for over 800,000 synthetic images, both on the texture and subtexture levels.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence.

Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.</p></details> | 18 pages,8 figures |

To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Do Concept Replacement Techniques Really Erase Unacceptable Concepts?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08991v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, particularly diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models, have demonstrated astounding success. However, aligning them to avoid generating content with unacceptable concepts (e.g., offensive or copyrighted content, or celebrity likenesses) remains a significant challenge. Concept replacement techniques (CRTs) aim to address this challenge, often by trying to "erase" unacceptable concepts from models. Recently, model providers have started offering image editing services which accept an image and a text prompt as input, to produce an image altered as specified by the prompt. These are known as image-to-image (I2I) models. In this paper, we first use an I2I model to empirically demonstrate that today's state-of-the-art CRTs do not in fact erase unacceptable concepts. Existing CRTs are thus likely to be ineffective in emerging I2I scenarios, despite their proven ability to remove unwanted concepts in T2I pipelines, highlighting the need to understand this discrepancy between T2I and I2I settings. Next, we argue that a good CRT, while replacing unacceptable concepts, should preserve other concepts specified in the inputs to generative models. We call this fidelity. Prior work on CRTs have neglected fidelity in the case of unacceptable concepts. Finally, we propose the use of targeted image-editing techniques to achieve both effectiveness and fidelity. We present such a technique, AntiMirror, and demonstrate its viability.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any generative model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript: 9 pages, 7 figures.

However, certain editing semantics are challenging to specify precisely using textual descriptions alone. A practical alternative involves learning editing semantics from paired source-target examples. Existing exemplar-based editing methods still rely on text prompts describing the change within paired examples or learning implicit text-based editing instructions. In this paper, we introduce PairEdit, a novel visual editing method designed to effectively learn complex editing semantics from a limited number of image pairs or even a single image pair, without using any textual guidance. We propose a target noise prediction that explicitly models semantic variations within paired images through a guidance direction term. Moreover, we introduce a content-preserving noise schedule to facilitate more effective semantic learning. We also propose optimizing distinct LoRAs to disentangle the learning of semantic variations from content. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PairEdit successfully learns intricate semantics while significantly improving content consistency compared to baseline methods.

While existing auto-encoding frameworks admit semantic latent spaces which can be manipulated for causal control, they struggle with scalability and fidelity. Advancements in diffusion models present opportunities for improving counterfactual image editing, having demonstrated state-of-the-art visual quality, human-aligned perception and representation learning capabilities. Here, we present a suite of diffusion-based causal mechanisms, introducing the notions of spatial, semantic and dynamic abduction. We propose a general framework that integrates semantic representations into diffusion models through the lens of Pearlian causality to edit images via a counterfactual reasoning process. To our knowledge, this is the first work to consider high-level semantic identity preservation for diffusion counterfactuals and to demonstrate how semantic control enables principled trade-offs between faithful causal control and identity preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada</p></details> |

However, it faces two key challenges: (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{i}}) point-based drag is often highly ambiguous and difficult to align with users' intentions; (\emph{\textcolor{magenta}{ii}}) current DBIE methods primarily rely on alternating between motion supervision and point tracking, which is not only cumbersome but also fails to produce high-quality results. These limitations motivate us to explore DBIE from a new perspective -- redefining it as deformation, rotation, and translation of user-specified handle regions. Thereby, by requiring users to explicitly specify both drag areas and types, we can effectively address the ambiguity issue. Furthermore, we propose a simple-yet-effective editing framework, dubbed \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}}. It unifies DBIE as a Latent Region Optimization (LRO) problem and solves it through Progressive Backward Self-Intervention (PBSI), simplifying the overall procedure of DBIE while further enhancing quality by fully leveraging region-level structure information and progressive guidance from intermediate drag states. We validate \textcolor{SkyBlue}{\textbf{DragNeXt}} on our NextBench, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly outperform existing approaches.

Additional to model upgrading with T2I, in this report, we present several key improvements. First, we develop an enhanced data curation pipeline with a meta-info paradigm and meta-info embedding strategy that help mix images from multiple data sources. This allows us to scale editing data effectively, and meta information is helpfult to connect VLM with diffusion model more closely. Second, we introduce a joint learning pipeline for computing a diffusion loss and reward losses. Finally, we evaluate SeedEdit 3.0 on our testing benchmarks, for real/synthetic image editing, where it achieves a best trade-off between multiple aspects, yielding a high usability rate of 56.1%, compared to SeedEdit 1.6 (38.4%), GPT4o (37.1%) and Gemini 2.0 (30.3%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://seed.bytedance.com/tech/seededit</p></details> |
| **[Bootstrapping World Models from Dynamics Models in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06006v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To what extent do vision-and-language foundation models possess a realistic world model (observation $\times$ action $\rightarrow$ observation) and a dynamics model (observation $\times$ observation $\rightarrow$ action), when actions are expressed through language? While open-source foundation models struggle with both, we find that fine-tuning them to acquire a dynamics model through supervision is significantly easier than acquiring a world model. In turn, dynamics models can be used to bootstrap world models through two main strategies: 1) weakly supervised learning from synthetic data and 2) inference time verification. Firstly, the dynamics model can annotate actions for unlabelled pairs of video frame observations to expand the training data. We further propose a new objective, where image tokens in observation pairs are weighted by their importance, as predicted by a recognition model. Secondly, the dynamics models can assign rewards to multiple samples of the world model to score them, effectively guiding search at inference time. We evaluate the world models resulting from both strategies through the task of action-centric image editing on Aurora-Bench. Our best model achieves a performance competitive with state-of-the-art image editing models, improving on them by a margin of $15\%$ on real-world subsets according to GPT4o-as-judge, and achieving the best average human evaluation across all subsets of Aurora-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[FADE: Frequency-Aware Diffusion Model Factorization for Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05934v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion frameworks have significantly enhanced video editing, achieving high fidelity and strong alignment with textual prompts. However, conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics, particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results, adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce FADE, a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models, we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights, we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore, we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues, preventing information leakage and supporting efficient, versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure. Extensive experiments on real-world videos demonstrate that our method consistently delivers high-quality, realistic and temporally coherent editing results both qualitatively and quantitatively.

| **[Invisible Backdoor Triggers in Image Editing Model via Deep Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04879v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in both image generation and editing. However, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, in which specific patterns embedded in the input can manipulate the model's behavior. Most existing research in this area has proposed attack frameworks focused on the image generation pipeline, leaving backdoor attacks in image editing relatively unexplored. Among the few studies targeting image editing, most utilize visible triggers, which are impractical because they introduce noticeable alterations to the input image before editing. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework that embeds invisible triggers into the image editing process via poisoned training data. We leverage off-the-shelf deep watermarking models to encode imperceptible watermarks as backdoor triggers. Our goal is to make the model produce the predefined backdoor target when it receives watermarked inputs, while editing clean images normally according to the given prompt. With extensive experiments across different watermarking models, the proposed method achieves promising attack success rates. In addition, the analysis results of the watermark characteristics in term of backdoor attack further support the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[HMAR: Efficient Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04421v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule. We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x respectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally, HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Image Editing As Programs with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04158v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions.

Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization.

Traditional methods rely on time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning for subject alignment, while recent zero-shot approaches leverage on-the-fly image prompting, often sacrificing subject alignment. In this paper, we introduce Diptych Prompting, a novel zero-shot approach that reinterprets as an inpainting task with precise subject alignment by leveraging the emergent property of diptych generation in large-scale text-to-image models. Diptych Prompting arranges an incomplete diptych with the reference image in the left panel, and performs text-conditioned inpainting on the right panel. We further prevent unwanted content leakage by removing the background in the reference image and improve fine-grained details in the generated subject by enhancing attention weights between the panels during inpainting. Experimental results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot image prompting methods, resulting in images that are visually preferred by users. Additionally, our method supports not only subject-driven generation but also stylized image generation and subject-driven image editing, demonstrating versatility across diverse image generation applications.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce RefEdit -- an instruction-based editing model trained on our scalable synthetic data generation pipeline. Our RefEdit, trained on only 20,000 editing triplets, outperforms the Flux/SD3 model-based baselines trained on millions of data.

Inversion within these models aims to recover the latent noise representation for a real or generated image, enabling reconstruction, editing, and other downstream tasks. However, to date, most inversion approaches suffer from an intrinsic trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and editing flexibility. This limitation arises from the difficulty of maintaining both semantic alignment and structural consistency during the inversion process. In this work, we introduce Dual-Conditional Inversion (DCI), a novel framework that jointly conditions on the source prompt and reference image to guide the inversion process. Specifically, DCI formulates the inversion process as a dual-condition fixed-point optimization problem, minimizing both the latent noise gap and the reconstruction error under the joint guidance. This design anchors the inversion trajectory in both semantic and visual space, leading to more accurate and editable latent representations. Our novel setup brings new understanding to the inversion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCI achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple editing tasks, significantly improving both reconstruction quality and editing precision. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our method achieves strong results in reconstruction tasks, implying a degree of robustness and generalizability approaching the ultimate goal of the inversion process.</p></details> |  |

Existing single-reference methods typically focus on style or appearance adjustments and struggle with non-rigid transformations. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging source-target image pairs to extract and transfer content-aware editing intent to novel query images. To this end, we introduce RelationAdapter, a lightweight module that enables Diffusion Transformer (DiT) based models to effectively capture and apply visual transformations from minimal examples. We also introduce Relation252K, a comprehensive dataset comprising 218 diverse editing tasks, to evaluate model generalization and adaptability in visual prompt-driven scenarios. Experiments on Relation252K show that RelationAdapter significantly improves the model's ability to understand and transfer editing intent, leading to notable gains in generation quality and overall editing performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Minimizing the Pretraining Gap: Domain-aligned Text-Based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10195v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on text-based person retrieval, which aims to identify individuals based on textual descriptions. Given the significant privacy issues and the high cost associated with manual annotation, synthetic data has become a popular choice for pretraining models, leading to notable advancements. However, the considerable domain gap between synthetic pretraining datasets and real-world target datasets, characterized by differences in lighting, color, and viewpoint, remains a critical obstacle that hinders the effectiveness of the pretrain-finetune paradigm. To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified text-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both image and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components, i.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and Multi-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the name implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images from the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain, e.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level alignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their descriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity. Extensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved state-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets, outperforming existing methodologies. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/Shuyu-XJTU/MRA.</p></details> |  |

It presents a significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures. Under review</p></details> |
| **[CAMeL: Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18782v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations.

Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset. The TVPReid dataset will be publicly available to benefit future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia</p></details> |

Prior works leverage pre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully fine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements compared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model is prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method for Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the multi-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously integrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and Adapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information with task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust global feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are optimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix is proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation of prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla prefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer normalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts caused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art results across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\% parameters.

Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures |

Tailoring CLIP to person domain is now a emerging research topic due to the abundant knowledge of vision-language pretraining, but challenges still remain during fine-tuning: (i) Previous full-model fine-tuning in TPR is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.(ii) Existing parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for TPR lacks of fine-grained feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose Domain-Aware Mixture-of-Adapters (DM-Adapter), which unifies Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and PETL to enhance fine-grained feature representations while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, Sparse Mixture-of-Adapters is designed in parallel to MLP layers in both vision and language branches, where different experts specialize in distinct aspects of person knowledge to handle features more finely. To promote the router to exploit domain information effectively and alleviate the routing imbalance, Domain-Aware Router is then developed by building a novel gating function and injecting learnable domain-aware prompts. Extensive experiments show that our DM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing ad vanced methods typically depend on vision-language pre trained (VLP) models to facilitate effective cross-modal alignment. However, the inherent constraints of VLP mod-els, which include the global alignment biases and insuffi-cient self-feedback regulation, impede optimal retrieval per formance. In this paper, we propose MeFa, a Multi-Pathway Exploration, Feedback, and Adjustment framework, which deeply explores intrinsic feedback of intra and inter-modal to make targeted adjustment, thereby achieving more precise person-text associations. Specifically, we first design an intra modal reasoning pathway that generates hard negative sam ples for cross-modal data, leveraging feedback from these samples to refine intra-modal reasoning, thereby enhancing sensitivity to subtle discrepancies. Subsequently, we intro duce a cross-modal refinement pathway that utilizes both global information and intermodal feedback to refine local in formation, thus enhancing its global semantic representation. Finally, the discriminative clue correction pathway incorpo rates fine-grained features of secondary similarity as discrim inative clues to further mitigate retrieval failures caused by disparities in these features. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that MeFa achieves superior person retrieval performance without necessitating additional data or complex structures.</p></details> |  |

Despite considerable efforts to bridge the gap between vision and language, the significant differences between these modalities continue to pose a challenge. Previous methods have attempted to align text and image samples in a modal-shared space, but they face uncertainties in optimization directions due to the movable features of both modalities and the failure to account for one-to-many relationships of image-text pairs in TPR datasets. To address this issue, we propose an effective bi-directional one-to-many embedding paradigm that offers a clear optimization direction for each sample, thus mitigating the optimization problem. Additionally, this embedding scheme generates multiple features for each sample without introducing trainable parameters, making it easier to align with several positive samples. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel Bi-directional one-to-many Embedding Alignment (Beat) model to address the TPR task. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Beat model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular TPR datasets, including CUHK-PEDES (65.61 R@1), ICFG-PEDES (58.25 R@1), and RSTPReID (48.10 R@1). Furthermore, additional experiments on MS-COCO, CUB, and Flowers datasets further demonstrate the potential of Beat to be applied to other image-text retrieval tasks.</p></details> | ACM MM2023 |

This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem, we contribute a new benchmark named \textbf{UFineBench} for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly, we construct a new \textbf{dataset} named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions, averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation, we also propose a special \textbf{evaluation paradigm} more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains, cross textual granularity and cross textual styles, named UFine3C, and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability, named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover, we propose CFAM, a more efficient \textbf{algorithm} especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation, CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets, especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore, by evaluating on UFine3C, we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets.

It supports multimodal tasks, including text-based person retrieval and human matching. One of the most significant challenges faced in Re-ID is clothes-changing, where the same person may appear in different outfits. While previous methods have made notable progress in maintaining clothing data consistency and handling clothing change data, they still rely excessively on clothing information, which can limit performance due to the dynamic nature of human appearances. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Pose-Guidance Deep Supervision (PGDS), an effective framework for learning pose guidance within the Re-ID task. It consists of three modules: a human encoder, a pose encoder, and a Pose-to-Human Projection module (PHP). Our framework guides the human encoder, i.e., the main re-identification model, with pose information from the pose encoder through multiple layers via the knowledge transfer mechanism from the PHP module, helping the human encoder learn body parts information without increasing computation resources in the inference stage. Through extensive experiments, our method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness for real-world applications.

The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training. However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets. This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR. LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information. In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training. LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR models. Comprehensive experiments on three TPR benchmarks show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models.</p></details> |  |

To close the gap, we study the problem of text-based person search in full images by proposing a new end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimize the pedestrian detection, identification and visual-semantic feature embedding tasks. To take full advantage of the query text, the semantic features are leveraged to instruct the Region Proposal Network to pay more attention to the text-described proposals. Besides, a cross-scale visual-semantic embedding mechanism is utilized to improve the performance. To validate the proposed method, we collect and annotate two large-scale benchmark datasets based on the widely adopted image-based person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets and compared with the baseline methods, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge lies in bridging the substantial gap between vision and language modalities, especially when dealing with limited large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a CLIP-based Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (CSKT) approach for TPR. Specifically, to explore the CLIP's knowledge on input side, we first propose a Bidirectional Prompts Transferring (BPT) module constructed by text-to-image and image-to-text bidirectional prompts and coupling projections. Secondly, Dual Adapters Transferring (DAT) is designed to transfer knowledge on output side of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in vision and language. This synergistic two-way collaborative mechanism promotes the early-stage feature fusion and efficiently exploits the existing knowledge of CLIP. CSKT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across three benchmark datasets when the training parameters merely account for 7.4% of the entire model, demonstrating its remarkable efficiency, effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP2024(accepted). minor typos revision compared to version 1 in arxiv</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset named PRW-TPS-CN based on the widely used person search dataset PRW. Our dataset contains 47,102 sentences, which means there is quite more information than existing dataset. These texts precisely describe the person images from top to bottom, which in line with the natural description order. We also provide both Chinese and English descriptions in our dataset for more comprehensive evaluation. These characteristics make our dataset more applicable. To alleviate the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval, we take advantage of the rich texts in PRW-TPS-CN dataset. We propose to aggregate multiple texts as text prototypes to maintain the prominent text features of a person, which can better reflect the whole character of a person. The overall prototypes lead to generating the image attention map to eliminate the detection misalignment causing the decrease of text-based person retrieval. Thus, the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval is largely alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments on the PRW-TPS-CN dataset. The experimental results show the PRW-TPS-CN dataset's effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

In particular, MALS contains 1,510,330 image-text pairs, which is about 37.5 times larger than prevailing CUHK-PEDES, and all images are annotated with 27 attributes. Considering the privacy concerns and annotation costs, we leverage the off-the-shelf diffusion models to generate the dataset. To verify the feasibility of learning from the generated data, we develop a new joint Attribute Prompt Learning and Text Matching Learning (APTM) framework, considering the shared knowledge between attribute and text. As the name implies, APTM contains an attribute prompt learning stream and a text matching learning stream. (1) The attribute prompt learning leverages the attribute prompts for image-attribute alignment, which enhances the text matching learning. (2) The text matching learning facilitates the representation learning on fine-grained details, and in turn, boosts the attribute prompt learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the pre-training on MALS, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance via APTM on three challenging real-world benchmarks. In particular, APTM achieves a consistent improvement of +6.96%, +7.68%, and +16.95% Recall@1 accuracy on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets by a clear margin, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Many previous approaches contrive to learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a \textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When mapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common manifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely invisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus so as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal common manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of the actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal data can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we propose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common Manifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our method, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\textit{san si er hou xing}', namely, to \textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping mechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to CDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the visual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality into C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on two text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05773</p></details> |

Existing methods generally face a \textbf{color over-reliance problem}, which means that the models rely heavily on color information when matching cross-modal data. Indeed, color information is an important decision-making accordance for retrieval, but the over-reliance on color would distract the model from other key clues (e.g. texture information, structural information, etc.), and thereby lead to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to \textbf{C}apture \textbf{A}ll-round \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}eyond \textbf{C}olor (\textbf{CAIBC}) via a jointly optimized multi-branch architecture for text-based person retrieval. CAIBC contains three branches including an RGB branch, a grayscale (GRS) branch and a color (CLR) branch. Besides, with the aim of making full use of all-round information in a balanced and effective way, a mutual learning mechanism is employed to enable the three branches which attend to varied aspects of information to communicate with and learn from each other. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to evaluate our proposed CAIBC method on the CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets in both \textbf{supervised} and \textbf{weakly supervised} text-based person retrieval settings, which demonstrates that CAIBC significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all the three tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22</p></details> |

The key is to learn a common latent space mapping between visual-textual modalities. To achieve this goal, existing works employ segmentation to obtain explicitly cross-modal alignments or utilize attention to explore salient alignments. These methods have two shortcomings: 1) Labeling cross-modal alignments are time-consuming. 2) Attention methods can explore salient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs. To relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT) framework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT utilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which contributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained alignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms: multi-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA module explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the BMM module aims to mine \textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and textual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES. Even without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of high-dimensional data, the unconstrained mapping paradigms are not able to properly catch discriminative clues about the corresponding person while drop the misaligned information. Intuitively, the information contained in visual data can be divided into person information (PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each other. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person information, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A surroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to realize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a mutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and multi-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse alignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only accessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES. To properly evaluate our proposed DSSL in the real scenarios, a Real Scenarios Text-based Person Reidentification (RSTPReid) dataset is constructed to benefit future research on text-based person retrieval, which will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'21</p></details> |

In this paper we propose a person retrieval system that uses textual queries (e.g., "black trousers and green shirt") as descriptions and a one-class generative color model with outlier filtering to represent the images both to train the models and to perform the search. The method is evaluated in terms of its efficiency in fulfilling the needs of a forensic retrieval system: limited annotation, robustness, extensibility, adaptability and computational cost. The proposed generative method is compared to a corresponding discriminative approach. Experiments are carried out using a range of queries in three different databases. The experiments show that the two evaluated algorithms provide average retrieval performance and adaptable to new datasets. The proposed generative algorithm has some advantages over the discriminative one, specifically its capability to work with very few training samples and its much lower computational requirements when the number of training examples increases.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multiple Information Prompt Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00330v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification is a subject closer to the real world, which focuses on solving the problem of person re-identification after pedestrians change clothes. The primary challenge in this field is to overcome the complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to identify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient data collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this problem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice. Current methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the original image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely limited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional model. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel multiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person ReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance of multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS) module is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB image features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The Bio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning intensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP) module is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the impact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID, Celeb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%, 66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively. When compared to AIM (CVPR23), ACID (TIP23), and SCNet (MM23), MIPL achieves rank-1 improvements of 11.3%, 13.8%, and 7.9%, respectively, on the PRCC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Clothes Changing Person ReID: Conflicts, Synthesis, and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12611v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same person wearing different outfits. Mainstream researches focus on designing advanced model structures and strategies to capture identity information independent of clothing. However, the same-clothes discrimination as the standard ReID learning objective in CC-ReID is persistently ignored in previous researches. In this study, we dive into the relationship between standard and clothes-changing~(CC) learning objectives, and bring the inner conflicts between these two objectives to the fore. We try to magnify the proportion of CC training pairs by supplementing high-fidelity clothes-varying synthesis, produced by our proposed Clothes-Changing Diffusion model. By incorporating the synthetic images into CC-ReID model training, we observe a significant improvement under CC protocol. However, such improvement sacrifices the performance under the standard protocol, caused by the inner conflict between standard and CC. For conflict mitigation, we decouple these objectives and re-formulate CC-ReID learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. By effectively regularizing the gradient curvature across multiple objectives and introducing preference restrictions, our MOO solution surpasses the single-task training paradigm. Our framework is model-agnostic, and demonstrates superior performance under both CC and standard ReID protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEFF: Improving Any Clothes-Changing Person ReID Model using Gallery Enrichment with Face Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13807v2)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) problem, given a query sample of a person, the goal is to determine the correct identity based on a labeled gallery in which the person appears in different clothes. Several models tackle this challenge by extracting clothes-independent features. However, the performance of these models is still lower for the clothes-changing setting compared to the same-clothes setting in which the person appears with the same clothes in the labeled gallery. As clothing-related features are often dominant features in the data, we propose a new process we call Gallery Enrichment, to utilize these features. In this process, we enrich the original gallery by adding to it query samples based on their face features, using an unsupervised algorithm. Additionally, we show that combining ReID and face feature extraction modules alongside an enriched gallery results in a more accurate ReID model, even for query samples with new outfits that do not include faces. Moreover, we claim that existing CC-ReID benchmarks do not fully represent real-world scenarios, and propose a new video CC-ReID dataset called 42Street, based on a theater play that includes crowded scenes and numerous clothes changes. When applied to multiple ReID models, our method (GEFF) achieves an average improvement of 33.5% and 6.7% in the Top-1 clothes-changing metric on the PRCC and LTCC benchmarks. Combined with the latest ReID models, our method achieves new SOTA results on the PRCC, LTCC, CCVID, LaST and VC-Clothes benchmarks and the proposed 42Street dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08387v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2108.04527</p></details> |
| **[Identity-Guided Collaborative Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04400v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information), cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised clothing change adaptive person ReID](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03702v2)** | 2021-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothing changes and lack of data labels are both crucial challenges in person ReID. For the former challenge, people may occur multiple times at different locations wearing different clothing. However, most of the current person ReID research works focus on the benchmarks in which a person's clothing is kept the same all the time. For the last challenge, some researchers try to make model learn information from a labeled dataset as a source to an unlabeled dataset. Whereas purely unsupervised training is less used. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems at the same time. We design a novel unsupervised model, Sync-Person-Cloud ReID, to solve the unsupervised clothing change person ReID problem. We developer a purely unsupervised clothing change person ReID pipeline with person sync augmentation operation and same person feature restriction. The person sync augmentation is to supply additional same person resources. These same person's resources can be used as part supervised input by same person feature restriction. The extensive experiments on clothing change ReID datasets show the out-performance of our methods.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Multigranular Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04527v1)** | 2021-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail. To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task, but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme (MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic information that is used to align the human attributes.</p></details> |  |

| **[Inverse Virtual Try-On: Generating Multi-Category Product-Style Images from Clothed Individuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21062v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While virtual try-on (VTON) systems aim to render a garment onto a target person image, this paper tackles the novel task of virtual try-off (VTOFF), which addresses the inverse problem: generating standardized product images of garments from real-world photos of clothed individuals. Unlike VTON, which must resolve diverse pose and style variations, VTOFF benefits from a consistent and well-defined output format -- typically a flat, lay-down-style representation of the garment -- making it a promising tool for data generation and dataset enhancement. However, existing VTOFF approaches face two major limitations: (i) difficulty in disentangling garment features from occlusions and complex poses, often leading to visual artifacts, and (ii) restricted applicability to single-category garments (e.g., upper-body clothes only), limiting generalization. To address these challenges, we present Text-Enhanced MUlti-category Virtual Try-Off (TEMU-VTOFF), a novel architecture featuring a dual DiT-based backbone with a modified multimodal attention mechanism for robust garment feature extraction. Our architecture is designed to receive garment information from multiple modalities like images, text, and masks to work in a multi-category setting. Finally, we propose an additional alignment module to further refine the generated visual details. Experiments on VITON-HD and Dress Code datasets show that TEMU-VTOFF sets a new state-of-the-art on the VTOFF task, significantly improving both visual quality and fidelity to the target garments.</p></details> |  |
