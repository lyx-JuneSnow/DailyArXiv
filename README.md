| **[Unsupervised Person Re-Identification: A Systematic Survey of Challenges and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06057v2)** | 2021-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) has been a significant research topic in the past decade due to its real-world applications and research significance. While supervised person Re-ID methods achieve superior performance over unsupervised counterparts, they can not scale to large unlabelled datasets and new domains due to the prohibitive labelling cost. Therefore, unsupervised person Re-ID has drawn increasing attention for its potential to address the scalability issue in person Re-ID. Unsupervised person Re-ID is challenging primarily due to lacking identity labels to supervise person feature learning. The corresponding solutions are diverse and complex, with various merits and limitations. Therefore, comprehensive surveys on this topic are essential to summarise challenges and solutions to foster future research. Existing person Re-ID surveys have focused on supervised methods from classifications and applications but lack detailed discussion on how the person Re-ID solutions address the underlying challenges. This survey review recent works on unsupervised person Re-ID from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of highly influential methods considering the four significant challenges in unsupervised person Re-ID: 1) lacking ground-truth identity labels to supervise person feature learning; 2) learning discriminative person features with pseudo-supervision; 3) learning cross-camera invariant person feature, and 4) the domain shift between datasets. We summarise and analyse evaluation results and provide insights on the effectiveness of the solutions. Finally, we discuss open issues and suggest some promising future research directions.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Weakly Supervised Person Re-ID: Differentiable Graphical Learning and A New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03845v3)** | 2020-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person re-identification (Re-ID) benefits greatly from the accurate annotations of existing datasets (e.g., CUHK03 [1] and Market-1501 [2]), which are quite expensive because each image in these datasets has to be assigned with a proper label. In this work, we ease the annotation of Re-ID by replacing the accurate annotation with inaccurate annotation, i.e., we group the images into bags in terms of time and assign a bag-level label for each bag. This greatly reduces the annotation effort and leads to the creation of a large-scale Re-ID benchmark called SYSU-30$k$. The new benchmark contains $30k$ individuals, which is about $20$ times larger than CUHK03 ($1.3k$ individuals) and Market-1501 ($1.5k$ individuals), and $30$ times larger than ImageNet ($1k$ categories). It sums up to 29,606,918 images. Learning a Re-ID model with bag-level annotation is called the weakly supervised Re-ID problem. To solve this problem, we introduce a differentiable graphical model to capture the dependencies from all images in a bag and generate a reliable pseudo label for each person image. The pseudo label is further used to supervise the learning of the Re-ID model. When compared with the fully supervised Re-ID models, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SYSU-30$k$ and other datasets. The code, dataset, and pretrained model will be available at \url{https://github.com/wanggrun/SYSU-30k}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TNNLS 2020</p></details> |
| **[CANU-ReID: A Conditional Adversarial Network for Unsupervised person Re-IDentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01308v2)** | 2020-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised person re-ID is the task of identifying people on a target data set for which the ID labels are unavailable during training. In this paper, we propose to unify two trends in unsupervised person re-ID: clustering & fine-tuning and adversarial learning. On one side, clustering groups training images into pseudo-ID labels, and uses them to fine-tune the feature extractor. On the other side, adversarial learning is used, inspired by domain adaptation, to match distributions from different domains. Since target data is distributed across different camera viewpoints, we propose to model each camera as an independent domain, and aim to learn domain-independent features. Straightforward adversarial learning yields negative transfer, we thus introduce a conditioning vector to mitigate this undesirable effect. In our framework, the centroid of the cluster to which the visual sample belongs is used as conditioning vector of our conditional adversarial network, where the vector is permutation invariant (clusters ordering does not matter) and its size is independent of the number of clusters. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose the use of conditional adversarial networks for unsupervised person re-ID. We evaluate the proposed architecture on top of two state-of-the-art clustering-based unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) methods on four different experimental settings with three different data sets and set the new state-of-the-art performance on all four of them. Our code and model will be made publicly available at https://team.inria.fr/perception/canu-reid/.</p></details> |  |

The current status-quo solutions are based on attention neural models. In this paper, we propose Attention and CL loss, which is a hybrid of center and Online Soft Mining (OSM) loss added to the attention loss on top of a temporal attention-based neural network. The proposed loss function applied with bag-of-tricks for training surpasses the state of the art on the common person Re-ID datasets, MARS and PRID 2011. Our source code is publicly available on github.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 Pag...</summary><p>2 Page (Student Abstract) accepted in AAAI-20</p></details> |

| **[KRIS-Bench: Benchmarking Next-Level Intelligent Image Editing Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16707v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have enabled significant progress in instruction-based image editing. However, while these models produce visually plausible outputs, their capacity for knowledge-based reasoning editing tasks remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce KRIS-Bench (Knowledge-based Reasoning in Image-editing Systems Benchmark), a diagnostic benchmark designed to assess models through a cognitively informed lens. Drawing from educational theory, KRIS-Bench categorizes editing tasks across three foundational knowledge types: Factual, Conceptual, and Procedural. Based on this taxonomy, we design 22 representative tasks spanning 7 reasoning dimensions and release 1,267 high-quality annotated editing instances. To support fine-grained evaluation, we propose a comprehensive protocol that incorporates a novel Knowledge Plausibility metric, enhanced by knowledge hints and calibrated through human studies. Empirical results on 10 state-of-the-art models reveal significant gaps in reasoning performance, highlighting the need for knowledge-centric benchmarks to advance the development of intelligent image editing systems.</p></details> | 39 pages, 36 figures |
| **[Understanding Generative AI Capabilities in Everyday Image Editing Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16181v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) holds significant promise for automating everyday image editing tasks, especially following the recent release of GPT-4o on March 25, 2025. However, what subjects do people most often want edited? What kinds of editing actions do they want to perform (e.g., removing or stylizing the subject)? Do people prefer precise edits with predictable outcomes or highly creative ones? By understanding the characteristics of real-world requests and the corresponding edits made by freelance photo-editing wizards, can we draw lessons for improving AI-based editors and determine which types of requests can currently be handled successfully by AI editors? In this paper, we present a unique study addressing these questions by analyzing 83k requests from the past 12 years (2013-2025) on the Reddit community, which collected 305k PSR-wizard edits. According to human ratings, approximately only 33% of requests can be fulfilled by the best AI editors (including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, SeedEdit). Interestingly, AI editors perform worse on low-creativity requests that require precise editing than on more open-ended tasks. They often struggle to preserve the identity of people and animals, and frequently make non-requested touch-ups. On the other side of the table, VLM judges (e.g., o1) perform differently from human judges and may prefer AI edits more than human edits.

| **[FragFake: A Dataset for Fine-Grained Detection of Edited Images with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15644v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained edited image detection of localized edits in images is crucial for assessing content authenticity, especially given that modern diffusion models and image editing methods can produce highly realistic manipulations. However, this domain faces three challenges: (1) Binary classifiers yield only a global real-or-fake label without providing localization; (2) Traditional computer vision methods often rely on costly pixel-level annotations; and (3) No large-scale, high-quality dataset exists for modern image-editing detection techniques. To address these gaps, we develop an automated data-generation pipeline to create FragFake, the first dedicated benchmark dataset for edited image detection, which includes high-quality images from diverse editing models and a wide variety of edited objects. Based on FragFake, we utilize Vision Language Models (VLMs) for the first time in the task of edited image classification and edited region localization. Experimental results show that fine-tuned VLMs achieve higher average Object Precision across all datasets, significantly outperforming pretrained models. We further conduct ablation and transferability analyses to evaluate the detectors across various configurations and editing scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to reformulate localized image edit detection as a vision-language understanding task, establishing a new paradigm for the field. We anticipate that this work will establish a solid foundation to facilitate and inspire subsequent research endeavors in the domain of multimodal content authenticity.</p></details> | 14pages,15 figures |
| **[CompBench: Benchmarking Complex Instruction-guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12200v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While real-world applications increasingly demand intricate scene manipulation, existing instruction-guided image editing benchmarks often oversimplify task complexity and lack comprehensive, fine-grained instructions. To bridge this gap, we introduce, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed for complex instruction-guided image editing. CompBench features challenging editing scenarios that incorporate fine-grained instruction following, spatial and contextual reasoning, thereby enabling comprehensive evaluation of image editing models' precise manipulation capabilities. To construct CompBench, We propose an MLLM-human collaborative framework with tailored task pipelines. Furthermore, we propose an instruction decoupling strategy that disentangles editing intents into four key dimensions: location, appearance, dynamics, and objects, ensuring closer alignment between instructions and complex editing requirements. Extensive evaluations reveal that CompBench exposes fundamental limitations of current image editing models and provides critical insights for the development of next-generation instruction-guided image editing systems. The dataset, code, and models are available in https://comp-bench.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[DragLoRA: Online Optimization of LoRA Adapters for Drag-based Image Editing in Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12427v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drag-based editing within pretrained diffusion model provides a precise and flexible way to manipulate foreground objects. Traditional methods optimize the input feature obtained from DDIM inversion directly, adjusting them iteratively to guide handle points towards target locations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited accuracy due to the low representation ability of the feature in motion supervision, as well as inefficiencies caused by the large search space required for point tracking. To address these limitations, we present DragLoRA, a novel framework that integrates LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters into the drag-based editing pipeline. To enhance the training of LoRA adapters, we introduce an additional denoising score distillation loss which regularizes the online model by aligning its output with that of the original model. Additionally, we improve the consistency of motion supervision by adapting the input features using the updated LoRA, giving a more stable and accurate input feature for subsequent operations. Building on this, we design an adaptive optimization scheme that dynamically toggles between two modes, prioritizing efficiency without compromising precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DragLoRA significantly enhances the control precision and computational efficiency for drag-based image editing. The Codes of DragLoRA are available at: https://github.com/Sylvie-X/DragLoRA.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[Unforgettable Lessons from Forgettable Images: Intra-Class Memorability Matters in Computer Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20761v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce intra-class memorability, where certain images within the same class are more memorable than others despite shared category characteristics. To investigate what features make one object instance more memorable than others, we design and conduct human behavior experiments, where participants are shown a series of images, and they must identify when the current image matches the image presented a few steps back in the sequence. To quantify memorability, we propose the Intra-Class Memorability score (ICMscore), a novel metric that incorporates the temporal intervals between repeated image presentations into its calculation. Furthermore, we curate the Intra-Class Memorability Dataset (ICMD), comprising over 5,000 images across ten object classes with their ICMscores derived from 2,000 participants' responses. Subsequently, we demonstrate the usefulness of ICMD by training AI models on this dataset for various downstream tasks: memorability prediction, image recognition, continual learning, and memorability-controlled image editing. Surprisingly, high-ICMscore images impair AI performance in image recognition and continual learning tasks, while low-ICMscore images improve outcomes in these tasks. Additionally, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art image diffusion model on ICMD image pairs with and without masked semantic objects. The diffusion model can successfully manipulate image elements to enhance or reduce memorability. Our contributions open new pathways in understanding intra-class memorability by scrutinizing fine-grained visual features behind the most and least memorable images and laying the groundwork for real-world applications in computer vision. We will release all code, data, and models publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-Preserving Zero-Shot Image Editing via Stage-Wise Latent Injection in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15723v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a diffusion-based framework for zero-shot image editing that unifies text-guided and reference-guided approaches without requiring fine-tuning. Our method leverages diffusion inversion and timestep-specific null-text embeddings to preserve the structural integrity of the source image. By introducing a stage-wise latent injection strategy-shape injection in early steps and attribute injection in later steps-we enable precise, fine-grained modifications while maintaining global consistency. Cross-attention with reference latents facilitates semantic alignment between the source and reference. Extensive experiments across expression transfer, texture transformation, and style infusion demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, confirming the method's scalability and adaptability to diverse image editing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Edit: Detecting and Localizing Edits in Images Altered by Text-Guided Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11753v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling highly realistic and local modifications based on textual prompts. While these developments expand creative possibilities, their malicious use poses substantial challenges for detection of such subtle deepfake edits. To this end, we introduce Explain Edit (X-Edit), a novel method for localizing diffusion-based edits in images. To localize the edits for an image, we invert the image using a pretrained diffusion model, then use these inverted features as input to a segmentation network that explicitly predicts the edited masked regions via channel and spatial attention. Further, we finetune the model using a combined segmentation and relevance loss. The segmentation loss ensures accurate mask prediction by balancing pixel-wise errors and perceptual similarity, while the relevance loss guides the model to focus on low-frequency regions and mitigate high-frequency artifacts, enhancing the localization of subtle edits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address and model the problem of localizing diffusion-based modified regions in images. We additionally contribute a new dataset of paired original and edited images addressing the current lack of resources for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that X-Edit accurately localizes edits in images altered by text-guided diffusion models, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics. This highlights X-Edit's potential as a robust forensic tool for detecting and pinpointing manipulations introduced by advanced image editing techniques.</p></details> | CVPR (XAI4CV) 2025 |
| **[GIE-Bench: Towards Grounded Evaluation for Text-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11493v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Editing images using natural language instructions has become a natural and expressive way to modify visual content; yet, evaluating the performance of such models remains challenging. Existing evaluation approaches often rely on image-text similarity metrics like CLIP, which lack precision. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to evaluate text-guided image editing models in a more grounded manner, along two critical dimensions: (i) functional correctness, assessed via automatically generated multiple-choice questions that verify whether the intended change was successfully applied; and (ii) image content preservation, which ensures that non-targeted regions of the image remain visually consistent using an object-aware masking technique and preservation scoring. The benchmark includes over 1000 high-quality editing examples across 20 diverse content categories, each annotated with detailed editing instructions, evaluation questions, and spatial object masks. We conduct a large-scale study comparing GPT-Image-1, the latest flagship in the text-guided image editing space, against several state-of-the-art editing models, and validate our automatic metrics against human ratings. Results show that GPT-Image-1 leads in instruction-following accuracy, but often over-modifies irrelevant image regions, highlighting a key trade-off in the current model behavior. GIE-Bench provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing more accurate evaluation of text-guided image editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D-Fixup: Advancing Photo Editing with 3D Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10566v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models, 3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames, we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in realistic image manipulation.

However, these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically specialize on a single editing task. We introduce a versatile, generative workflow that operates in an intrinsic-image latent space, enabling semantic, local manipulation with pixel precision for a range of editing operations. Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal, global relighting, and their combinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025 Journal track</p></details> |
| **[Don't Forget your Inverse DDIM for Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09571v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of text-to-image generation has undergone significant advancements with the introduction of diffusion models. Nevertheless, the challenge of editing real images persists, as most methods are either computationally intensive or produce poor reconstructions. This paper introduces SAGE (Self-Attention Guidance for image Editing) - a novel technique leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for image editing. SAGE builds upon the DDIM algorithm and incorporates a novel guidance mechanism utilizing the self-attention layers of the diffusion U-Net. This mechanism computes a reconstruction objective based on attention maps generated during the inverse DDIM process, enabling efficient reconstruction of unedited regions without the need to precisely reconstruct the entire input image. Thus, SAGE directly addresses the key challenges in image editing. The superiority of SAGE over other methods is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations and confirmed by a statistically validated comprehensive user study, in which all 47 surveyed users preferred SAGE over competing methods. Additionally, SAGE ranks as the top-performing method in seven out of 10 quantitative analyses and secures second and third places in the remaining three.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, code available at https://guillermogotre.github.io/sage/</p></details> |

Starting from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, PRISM proposes an effective fine-tuning strategy to produce RGB images along with intrinsic maps (referred to as X layers) simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches, which infer intrinsic properties individually or require separate models for decomposition and conditional generation, PRISM maintains consistency across modalities by generating all intrinsic layers jointly. It supports diverse tasks, including text-to-RGBX generation, RGB-to-X decomposition, and X-to-RGBX conditional generation. Additionally, PRISM enables both global and local image editing through conditioning on selected intrinsic layers and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of PRISM both for intrinsic image decomposition and conditional image generation while preserving the base model's text-to-image generation capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDE-Edit: Masked Dual-Editing for Multi-Object Image Editing via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05101v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object editing aims to modify multiple objects or regions in complex scenes while preserving structural coherence. This task faces significant challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1) Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment, leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality, offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> |

Remarkably, these models can achieve this even with a small number of training samples despite a large image dimension, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by leveraging key empirical observations: (i) the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data, (ii) a union of manifold structure of image data, and (iii) the low-rank property of the denoising autoencoder in trained diffusion models. These observations motivate us to assume the underlying data distribution of image data as a mixture of low-rank Gaussians and to parameterize the denoising autoencoder as a low-rank model according to the score function of the assumed distribution. With these setups, we rigorously show that optimizing the training loss of diffusion models is equivalent to solving the canonical subspace clustering problem over the training samples. Based on this equivalence, we further show that the minimal number of samples required to learn the underlying distribution scales linearly with the intrinsic dimensions under the above data and model assumptions. This insight sheds light on why diffusion models can break the curse of dimensionality and exhibit the phase transition in learning distributions. Moreover, we empirically establish a correspondence between the subspaces and the semantic representations of image data, facilitating image editing. We validate these results with corroborated experimental results on both simulated distributions and image datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[GlyphMastero: A Glyph Encoder for High-Fidelity Scene Text Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04915v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene text editing, a subfield of image editing, requires modifying texts in images while preserving style consistency and visual coherence with the surrounding environment. While diffusion-based methods have shown promise in text generation, they still struggle to produce high-quality results. These methods often generate distorted or unrecognizable characters, particularly when dealing with complex characters like Chinese. In such systems, characters are composed of intricate stroke patterns and spatial relationships that must be precisely maintained. We present GlyphMastero, a specialized glyph encoder designed to guide the latent diffusion model for generating texts with stroke-level precision. Our key insight is that existing methods, despite using pretrained OCR models for feature extraction, fail to capture the hierarchical nature of text structures - from individual strokes to stroke-level interactions to overall character-level structure. To address this, our glyph encoder explicitly models and captures the cross-level interactions between local-level individual characters and global-level text lines through our novel glyph attention module. Meanwhile, our model implements a feature pyramid network to fuse the multi-scale OCR backbone features at the global-level. Through these cross-level and multi-scale fusions, we obtain more detailed glyph-aware guidance, enabling precise control over the scene text generation process. Our method achieves an 18.02\% improvement in sentence accuracy over the state-of-the-art multi-lingual scene text editing baseline, while simultaneously reducing the text-region Fr\'echet inception distance by 53.28\%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Prior scene layout generation methods are either closed-vocabulary or use proprietary large language models for open-vocabulary generation, limiting their modeling capabilities and broader applicability in controllable image generation. In this work, we propose to use lightweight open-source language models to obtain scene elements from text prompts and a novel aspect-aware diffusion Transformer architecture trained in an open-vocabulary manner for conditional layout generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayouSyn outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging spatial and numerical reasoning benchmarks. Additionally, we present two applications of LayouSyn. First, we show that coarse initialization from large language models can be seamlessly combined with our method to achieve better results. Second, we present a pipeline for adding objects to images, demonstrating the potential of LayouSyn in image editing applications.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, this project provides an open-source implementation of the integrated MetaQueries and M2-omni framework, while introducing the novel multi-scale learnable tokens and multi-scale representation alignment strategy. By leveraging a fixed MLLM and a learnable diffusion model, Ming-Lite-Uni enables native multimodal AR models to perform both text-to-image generation and instruction based image editing tasks, expanding their capabilities beyond pure visual understanding. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of Ming-Lite-Uni and illustrate the impressive fluid nature of its interactive process.

| **[Multi-turn Consistent Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04320v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications, such as interactive photo retouching, artistic content creation, and product design, require flexible and iterative image editing. However, existing image editing methods primarily focus on achieving the desired modifications in a single step, which often struggles with ambiguous user intent, complex transformations, or the need for progressive refinements. As a result, these methods frequently produce inconsistent outcomes or fail to meet user expectations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-turn image editing framework that enables users to iteratively refine their edits, progressively achieving more satisfactory results. Our approach leverages flow matching for accurate image inversion and a dual-objective Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR) for stable sampling, effectively mitigating error accumulation. Additionally, by analyzing the layer-wise roles of transformers, we introduce a adaptive attention highlighting method that enhances editability while preserving multi-turn coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves edit success rates and visual fidelity compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GAN inversion methods struggle to balance high reconstruction quality, effective editability, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce MambaStyle, an efficient single-stage encoder-based approach for GAN inversion and editing that leverages vision state-space models (VSSMs) to address these challenges. Specifically, our approach integrates VSSMs within the proposed architecture, enabling high-quality image inversion and flexible editing with significantly fewer parameters and reduced computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments show that MambaStyle achieves a superior balance among inversion accuracy, editing quality, and computational efficiency. Notably, our method achieves superior inversion and editing results with reduced model complexity and faster inference, making it suitable for real-time applications.</p></details> |  |

The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code: https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step1X-Edit</p></details> |

Previous large-scale editing datasets often incorporate minimal human feedback, leading to challenges in aligning datasets with human preferences. HumanEdit bridges this gap by employing human annotators to construct data pairs and administrators to provide feedback. With meticulously curation, HumanEdit comprises 5,751 images and requires more than 2,500 hours of human effort across four stages, ensuring both accuracy and reliability for a wide range of image editing tasks. The dataset includes six distinct types of editing instructions: Action, Add, Counting, Relation, Remove, and Replace, encompassing a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. All images in the dataset are accompanied by masks, and for a subset of the data, we ensure that the instructions are sufficiently detailed to support mask-free editing. Furthermore, HumanEdit offers comprehensive diversity and high-resolution $1024 \times 1024$ content sourced from various domains, setting a new versatile benchmark for instructional image editing datasets. With the aim of advancing future research and establishing evaluation benchmarks in the field of image editing, we release HumanEdit at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BryanW/HumanEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation (AI4CC) Workshop.

However, current inversion-based approaches struggle with big modifications (e.g., adding or removing objects) due to the structured nature of inversion noise, which hinders substantial changes. Meanwhile, instruction-based methods often constrain users to black-box operations, limiting direct interaction for specifying editing regions and intensity. To address these limitations, we propose BrushEdit, a novel inpainting-based instruction-guided image editing paradigm, which leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image inpainting models to enable autonomous, user-friendly, and interactive free-form instruction editing. Specifically, we devise a system enabling free-form instruction editing by integrating MLLMs and a dual-branch image inpainting model in an agent-cooperative framework to perform editing category classification, main object identification, mask acquisition, and editing area inpainting. Extensive experiments show that our framework effectively combines MLLMs and inpainting models, achieving superior performance across seven metrics including mask region preservation and editing effect coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>WebPa...</summary><p>WebPage available at https://liyaowei-stu.github.io/project/BrushEdit/</p></details> |
| **[SuperEdit: Rectifying and Facilitating Supervision for Instruction-Based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02370v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the challenges of manually collecting accurate editing data, existing datasets are typically constructed using various automated methods, leading to noisy supervision signals caused by the mismatch between editing instructions and original-edited image pairs. Recent efforts attempt to improve editing models through generating higher-quality edited images, pre-training on recognition tasks, or introducing vision-language models (VLMs) but fail to resolve this fundamental issue. In this paper, we offer a novel solution by constructing more effective editing instructions for given image pairs. This includes rectifying the editing instructions to better align with the original-edited image pairs and using contrastive editing instructions to further enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, we find that editing models exhibit specific generation attributes at different inference steps, independent of the text. Based on these prior attributes, we define a unified guide for VLMs to rectify editing instructions. However, there are some challenging editing scenarios that cannot be resolved solely with rectified instructions. To this end, we further construct contrastive supervision signals with positive and negative instructions and introduce them into the model training using triplet loss, thereby further facilitating supervision effectiveness. Our method does not require the VLM modules or pre-training tasks used in previous work, offering a more direct and efficient way to provide better supervision signals, and providing a novel, simple, and effective solution for instruction-based image editing. Results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. Compared with previous SOTA SmartEdit, we achieve 9.19% improvements on the Real-Edit benchmark with 30x less training data and 13x smaller model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, Data and Models are available at: https://github.com/bytedance/SuperEdit</p></details> |
| **[ParallelEdits: Efficient Multi-object Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00985v4)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses. In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads. Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Editability in Image Generation with Layer-wise Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01079v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most real-world image editing tasks require multiple sequential edits to achieve desired results. Current editing approaches, primarily designed for single-object modifications, struggle with sequential editing: especially with maintaining previous edits along with adapting new objects naturally into the existing content. These limitations significantly hinder complex editing scenarios where multiple objects need to be modified while preserving their contextual relationships. We address this fundamental challenge through two key proposals: enabling rough mask inputs that preserve existing content while naturally integrating new elements and supporting consistent editing across multiple modifications. Our framework achieves this through layer-wise memory, which stores latent representations and prompt embeddings from previous edits. We propose Background Consistency Guidance that leverages memorized latents to maintain scene coherence and Multi-Query Disentanglement in cross-attention that ensures natural adaptation to existing content. To evaluate our method, we present a new benchmark dataset incorporating semantic alignment metrics and interactive editing scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate superior performance in iterative image editing tasks with minimal user effort, requiring only rough masks while maintaining high-quality results throughout multiple editing steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

This technical report presents the first-look evaluation benchmark (named GPT-ImgEval), quantitatively and qualitatively diagnosing GPT-4o's performance across three critical dimensions: (1) generation quality, (2) editing proficiency, and (3) world knowledge-informed semantic synthesis. Across all three tasks, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in both image generation control and output quality, while also showcasing exceptional knowledge reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, based on the GPT-4o's generated data, we propose a classification-model-based approach to investigate the underlying architecture of GPT-4o, where our empirical results suggest the model consists of an auto-regressive (AR) combined with a diffusion-based head for image decoding, rather than the VAR-like architectures. We also provide a complete speculation on GPT-4o's overall architecture. In addition, we conduct a series of analyses to identify and visualize GPT-4o's specific limitations and the synthetic artifacts commonly observed in its image generation. We also present a comparative study of multi-round image editing between GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, and discuss the safety implications of GPT-4o's outputs, particularly their detectability by existing image forensic models. We hope that our work can offer valuable insight and provide a reliable benchmark to guide future research, foster reproducibility, and accelerate innovation in the field of image generation and beyond.

Physics-based weather simulation requires precise reconstructions that are hard to scale to in-the-wild videos, while current video editing often lacks realism and control. In this work, we introduce WeatherWeaver, a video diffusion model that synthesizes diverse weather effects -- including rain, snow, fog, and clouds -- directly into any input video without the need for 3D modeling. Our model provides precise control over weather effect intensity and supports blending various weather types, ensuring both realism and adaptability. To overcome the scarcity of paired training data, we propose a novel data strategy combining synthetic videos, generative image editing, and auto-labeled real-world videos. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in weather simulation and removal, providing high-quality, physically plausible, and scene-identity-preserving results over various real-world videos.</p></details> |  |

However, there is no widely-accepted standard evaluation method mainly due to the subjective nature of the task, letting researchers rely on manual user study. To address this, we introduce a novel Human-Aligned benchmark for Text-guided Image Editing (HATIE). Providing a large-scale benchmark set covering a wide range of editing tasks, it allows reliable evaluation, not limited to specific easy-to-evaluate cases. Also, HATIE provides a fully-automated and omnidirectional evaluation pipeline. Particularly, we combine multiple scores measuring various aspects of editing so as to align with human perception. We empirically verify that the evaluation of HATIE is indeed human-aligned in various aspects, and provide benchmark results on several state-of-the-art models to provide deeper insights on their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 (highlight)</p></details> |
| **[InstructAttribute: Fine-grained Object Attributes editing with Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00751v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, renowned for their advanced generative abilities, are extensively utilized in image editing applications, demonstrating remarkable effectiveness. However, achieving precise control over fine-grained attributes still presents considerable challenges. Existing image editing techniques either fail to modify the attributes of an object or struggle to preserve its structure and maintain consistency in other areas of the image. To address these challenges, we propose the Structure-Preserving and Attribute Amplification (SPAA), a training-free method which enables precise control over the color and material transformations of objects by editing the self-attention maps and cross-attention values. Furthermore, we constructed the Attribute Dataset, which encompasses nearly all colors and materials associated with various objects, by integrating multimodal large language models (MLLM) to develop an automated pipeline for data filtering and instruction labeling. Training on this dataset, we present our InstructAttribute, an instruction-based model designed to facilitate fine-grained editing of color and material attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in object-level color and material editing, outperforming existing instruction-based image editing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[PixelHacker: Image Inpainting with Structural and Semantic Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20438v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image inpainting is a fundamental research area between image editing and image generation. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have explored novel attention mechanisms, lightweight architectures, and context-aware modeling, demonstrating impressive performance. However, they often struggle with complex structure (e.g., texture, shape, spatial relations) and semantics (e.g., color consistency, object restoration, and logical correctness), leading to artifacts and inappropriate generation. To address this challenge, we design a simple yet effective inpainting paradigm called latent categories guidance, and further propose a diffusion-based model named PixelHacker. Specifically, we first construct a large dataset containing 14 million image-mask pairs by annotating foreground and background (potential 116 and 21 categories, respectively). Then, we encode potential foreground and background representations separately through two fixed-size embeddings, and intermittently inject these features into the denoising process via linear attention. Finally, by pre-training on our dataset and fine-tuning on open-source benchmarks, we obtain PixelHacker. Extensive experiments show that PixelHacker comprehensively outperforms the SOTA on a wide range of datasets (Places2, CelebA-HQ, and FFHQ) and exhibits remarkable consistency in both structure and semantics.

However, due to attention leakage and collision between the cross-attention map of the object and the new color attribute from the text prompt, text-guided image editing methods may fail to change the color of an object, resulting in a misalignment between the resulting image and the text prompt. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the process of text-guided image synthesizing and what semantic information different cross-attention blocks have learned. We observe that the visual representation of an object is determined in the up-block of the diffusion model in the early stage of the denoising process, and color adjustment can be achieved through value matrices alignment in the cross-attention layer. Based on our findings, we propose a straightforward, yet stable, and effective image-guided method to modify the color of an object without requiring any additional fine-tuning or training. Lastly, we present a benchmark dataset called COLORBENCH, the first benchmark to evaluate the performance of color change methods. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in object-level color editing and surpass the performance of popular text-guided image editing approaches in both synthesized and real images.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning methods demand significant computational resources and large datasets, while training-free techniques struggle with instruction comprehension and edit quality. We resolve this dilemma by leveraging large-scale Diffusion Transformer (DiT)' enhanced generation capacity and native contextual awareness. Our solution introduces three contributions: (1) an in-context editing framework for zero-shot instruction compliance using in-context prompting, avoiding structural changes; (2) a LoRA-MoE hybrid tuning strategy that enhances flexibility with efficient adaptation and dynamic expert routing, without extensive retraining; and (3) an early filter inference-time scaling method using vision-language models (VLMs) to select better initial noise early, improving edit quality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's superiority: it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring only 0.5% training data and 1% trainable parameters compared to conventional baselines.

However, these methods remain far from practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio, limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we present \omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in four folds: (1) \omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o) instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle any image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of different aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different tasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that \omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models.

Generated conditionally from real images and textual prompts, these edits are often imperceptible to both humans and existing detection systems, revealing significant limitations in current defenses. We propose a novel multimodal capsule network, CapsFake, designed to detect such deepfake image edits by integrating low-level capsules from visual, textual, and frequency-domain modalities. High-level capsules, predicted through a competitive routing mechanism, dynamically aggregate local features to identify manipulated regions with precision. Evaluated on diverse datasets, including MagicBrush, Unsplash Edits, Open Images Edits, and Multi-turn Edits, CapsFake outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 20% in detection accuracy. Ablation studies validate its robustness, achieving detection rates above 94% under natural perturbations and 96% against adversarial attacks, with excellent generalization to unseen editing scenarios.

Alternatively, leveraging advanced text-to-image models such as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion has emerged as an efficient strategy, enabling the automatic generation of synthetic data in place of manual annotations. However, previous methods have been limited to generating single-instance images, as the generation of multiple instances with Stable Diffusion has proven unstable. To address this limitation and expand the scope and diversity of synthetic datasets, we propose a framework \textbf{Free-Mask} that combines a Diffusion Model for segmentation with advanced image editing capabilities, allowing for the integration of multiple objects into images via text-to-image models. Our method facilitates the creation of highly realistic datasets that closely emulate open-world environments while generating accurate segmentation masks. It reduces the labor associated with manual annotation and also ensures precise mask generation. Experimental results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by \textbf{Free-Mask} enables segmentation models to outperform those trained on real data, especially in zero-shot settings. Notably, \textbf{Free-Mask} achieves new state-of-the-art results on previously unseen classes in the VOC 2012 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages,11 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

When trying to apply consecutive edit operations using current models, they accumulate artifacts and noise due to repeated transitions between pixel and latent spaces. Some methods have attempted to address this limitation by performing the entire edit chain within the latent space, sacrificing flexibility by supporting only a limited, predetermined set of diffusion editing operations. We present a RE-encode decode (REED) training scheme for variational autoencoders (VAEs), which promotes image quality preservation even after many iterations. Our work enables multi-method iterative image editing: users can perform a variety of iterative edit operations, with each operation building on the output of the previous one using both diffusion-based operations and conventional editing techniques. We demonstrate the advantage of REED-VAE across a range of image editing scenarios, including text-based and mask-based editing frameworks. In addition, we show how REED-VAE enhances the overall editability of images, increasing the likelihood of successful and precise edit operations.

Attackers with access to user images can exploit these tools for malicious edits. Recent defenses attempt to protect images by adding a limited noise in the pixel space to disrupt the functioning of diffusion-based editing models. However, the adversarial noise added by previous methods is easily noticeable to the human eye. Moreover, most of these methods are not robust to purification techniques like JPEG compression under a feasible pixel budget. We propose a novel optimization approach that introduces adversarial perturbations directly in the frequency domain by modifying the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of the input image. By leveraging the JPEG pipeline, our method generates adversarial images that effectively prevent malicious image editing. Extensive experiments across a variety of tasks and datasets demonstrate that our approach introduces fewer visual artifacts while maintaining similar levels of edit protection and robustness to noise purification techniques.</p></details> |  |

One limitation of GAN-based image generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space. Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its application. This paper introduces the concept of "generative fields" to explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at synthesis time.</p></details> |  |

Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we introduce UniVG, a generalist diffusion model capable of supporting a diverse range of image generation tasks with a single set of weights. UniVG treats multi-modal inputs as unified conditions to enable various downstream applications, ranging from T2I generation, inpainting, instruction-based editing, identity-preserving generation, and layout-guided generation, to depth estimation and referring segmentation. Through comprehensive empirical studies on data mixing and multi-task training, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs. For example, we show that T2I generation and other tasks, such as instruction-based editing, can coexist without performance trade-offs, while auxiliary tasks like depth estimation and referring segmentation enhance image editing. Notably, our model can even outperform some task-specific models on their respective benchmarks, marking a significant step towards a unified image generation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[MirrorVerse: Pushing Diffusion Models to Realistically Reflect the World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15397v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become central to various image editing tasks, yet they often fail to fully adhere to physical laws, particularly with effects like shadows, reflections, and occlusions. In this work, we address the challenge of generating photorealistic mirror reflections using diffusion-based generative models. Despite extensive training data, existing diffusion models frequently overlook the nuanced details crucial to authentic mirror reflections. Recent approaches have attempted to resolve this by creating synhetic datasets and framing reflection generation as an inpainting task; however, they struggle to generalize across different object orientations and positions relative to the mirror. Our method overcomes these limitations by introducing key augmentations into the synthetic data pipeline: (1) random object positioning, (2) randomized rotations, and (3) grounding of objects, significantly enhancing generalization across poses and placements. To further address spatial relationships and occlusions in scenes with multiple objects, we implement a strategy to pair objects during dataset generation, resulting in a dataset robust enough to handle these complex scenarios. Achieving generalization to real-world scenes remains a challenge, so we introduce a three-stage training curriculum to develop the MirrorFusion 2.0 model to improve real-world performance. We provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to support our approach.

Although recent efforts have explored localized AIGC detection, existing datasets predominantly focus on object-level forgeries while overlooking broader scene edits in regions such as sky or ground. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000 locally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on semantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed through a fully automated Perception-Creation-Evaluation pipeline to ensure semantic coherence and visual realism. In addition, we further propose \textbf{NFA-ViT}, a Noise-guided Forgery Amplification Vision Transformer that enhances the detection of localized forgeries by amplifying forgery-related features across the entire image. NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in images, \emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints. Subsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction between normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the generalization traces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a broader context and improving overall detection robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BR-Gen constructs entirely new scenarios that are not covered by existing methods. Take a step further, NFA-ViT outperforms existing methods on BR-Gen and generalizes well across current benchmarks. All data and codes are available at https://github.com/clpbc/BR-Gen.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we expand the application of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition tasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the complex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask. By explicitly modeling the insertion mask in the diffusion process, MADD effectively facilitates the notion of affordance. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization performance on in-the-wild images.

However, current LLMs for UI generation tend to offer generic solutions that lack a nuanced understanding of task context and user preferences. We present CrowdGenUI, a framework that enhances LLM-based UI generation with crowdsourced user preferences. This framework addresses the limitations by guiding LLM reasoning with real user preferences, enabling the generation of UI widgets that reflect user needs and task-specific requirements. We evaluate our framework in the image editing domain by collecting a library of 720 user preferences from 50 participants, covering preferences such as predictability, efficiency, and explorability of various UI widgets. A user study (N=78) demonstrates that UIs generated with our preference-guided framework can better match user intentions compared to those generated by LLMs alone, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We further discuss the study findings and present insights for future research on LLM-based user-centered UI generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MP-Mat: A 3D-and-Instance-Aware Human Matting and Editing Framework with Multiplane Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14606v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human instance matting aims to estimate an alpha matte for each human instance in an image, which is challenging as it easily fails in complex cases requiring disentangling mingled pixels belonging to multiple instances along hairy and thin boundary structures. In this work, we address this by introducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with multiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two different perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically, we first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into multiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene representation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting instances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and boundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce another multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level perspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color. We also treat background as a special instance, which is often overlooked by existing methods. Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and background content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like image editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize controllable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive experiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task. We also demonstrate its superiority in image editing tasks, an area under-explored by existing matting-focused methods, where our approach under zero-shot inference even outperforms trained specialized image editing techniques by large margins.

| **[Visual Prompting for One-shot Controllable Video Editing without Inversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14335v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot controllable video editing (OCVE) is an important yet challenging task, aiming to propagate user edits that are made -- using any image editing tool -- on the first frame of a video to all subsequent frames, while ensuring content consistency between edited frames and source frames. To achieve this, prior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent noise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the user-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM inversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from accurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content consistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel perspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency models that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence of content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the source frames. Moreover, we introduce a temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across the edited frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | accepted by cvpr2025 |
| **[Fashion-RAG: Multimodal Fashion Image Editing via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14011v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the fashion industry has increasingly adopted AI technologies to enhance customer experience, driven by the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and virtual applications. Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.</p></details> | IJCNN 2025 |
| **[DialogGen: Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System for Multi-turn Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08857v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation models have significantly advanced in recent years. However, effective interaction with these models is challenging for average users due to the need for specialized prompt engineering knowledge and the inability to perform multi-turn image generation, hindering a dynamic and iterative creation process. Recent attempts have tried to equip Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with T2I models to bring the user's natural language instructions into reality. Hence, the output modality of MLLMs is extended, and the multi-turn generation quality of T2I models is enhanced thanks to the strong multi-modal comprehension ability of MLLMs. However, many of these works face challenges in identifying correct output modalities and generating coherent images accordingly as the number of output modalities increases and the conversations go deeper. Therefore, we propose DialogGen, an effective pipeline to align off-the-shelf MLLMs and T2I models to build a Multi-modal Interactive Dialogue System (MIDS) for multi-turn Text-to-Image generation. It is composed of drawing prompt alignment, careful training data curation, and error correction. Moreover, as the field of MIDS flourishes, comprehensive benchmarks are urgently needed to evaluate MIDS fairly in terms of output modality correctness and multi-modal output coherence. To address this issue, we introduce the Multi-modal Dialogue Benchmark (DialogBen), a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to assess the ability of MLLMs to generate accurate and coherent multi-modal content that supports image editing. It contains two evaluation metrics to measure the model's ability to switch modalities and the coherence of the output images. Our extensive experiments on DialogBen and user study demonstrate the effectiveness of DialogGen compared with other State-of-the-Art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hunyuan-dialoggen.github.io/.

| **[Early Timestep Zero-Shot Candidate Selection for Instruction-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13490v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.</p></details> |  |

To develop this benchmark, we harness GPT-4o to automatically collect a diverse set of editing instructions at scale. Our approach follows a well-structured ``Chain-of-Edit'' pipeline: we first generate individual atomic editing tasks independently and then integrate them to form cohesive, complex instructions. Additionally, we introduce a suite of metrics to assess various aspects of editing performance, along with a VLM-based auto-evaluation pipeline that supports large-scale assessments. Our benchmark yields several notable insights: 1) Open-source models significantly underperform relative to proprietary, closed-source models, with the performance gap widening as instruction complexity increases; 2) Increased instructional complexity primarily impairs the models' ability to retain key elements from the input images and to preserve the overall aesthetic quality; 3) Decomposing a complex instruction into a sequence of atomic steps, executed in a step-by-step manner, substantially degrades performance across multiple metrics; 4) A straightforward Best-of-N selection strategy improves results for both direct editing and the step-by-step sequential approach; and 5) We observe a ``curse of synthetic data'': when synthetic data is involved in model training, the edited images from such models tend to appear increasingly synthetic as the complexity of the editing instructions rises -- a phenomenon that intriguingly also manifests in the latest GPT-4o outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/Complex-Edit/, Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-VLAA/Complex-Edit</p></details> |

First, we propose Uni-Inv, an effective inversion method designed for accurate reconstruction. Building on this, we extend the concept of delayed injection to flow models and introduce Uni-Edit, a region-aware, robust image editing approach. Our methodology is tuning-free, model-agnostic, efficient, and effective, enabling diverse edits while ensuring strong preservation of edit-irrelevant regions.

As the quality of base-model generated images continues to improve, so does the demand for further application like image editing. In recent years, many remarkable works are realizing a wide variety of editing effects. However, the wide variety of editing types and diverse editing approaches have made it difficult for researchers to establish a comprehensive view of the development of this field. In this survey, we summarize the image editing field from four aspects: tasks definition, methods classification, results evaluation and editing datasets. First, we provide a definition of image editing, which in turn leads to a variety of editing task forms from the perspective of operation parts and manipulation actions. Subsequently, we categorize and summary methods for implementing editing into three categories: inversion-based, fine-tuning-based and adapter-based. In addition, we organize the currently used metrics, available datasets and corresponding construction methods. At the end, we present some visions for the future development of the image editing field based on the previous summaries.</p></details> |  |

We introduce an online reinforcement learning framework that aligns the diffusion model with human preferences without relying on extensive human annotations or curating a large dataset. Our method significantly improves the realism and alignment with instructions in two ways. First, the proposed models achieve precise and structurally coherent modifications in complex scenes while maintaining high fidelity in instruction-irrelevant areas. Second, they capture fine nuances in the desired edit by leveraging a visual prompt, enabling detailed control over visual edits without lengthy textual prompts. This approach simplifies users' efforts to achieve highly specific edits, requiring only 5 reference images depicting a certain concept for training. Experimental results demonstrate that our models can perform intricate edits in complex scenes, after just 10 training steps. Finally, we showcase the versatility of our method by applying it to robotics, where enhancing the visual realism of simulated environments through targeted sim-to-real image edits improves their utility as proxies for real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image.

Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images to extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in GANs include 3D-aware models such as EG3D, which feature efficient triplane-based architectures capable of reconstructing 3D geometry from single images. However, limited attention has been given to providing an integrated framework for 3D-aware, high-quality, reference-based image editing. This study addresses this gap by exploring and demonstrating the effectiveness of the triplane space for advanced reference-based edits. Our novel approach integrates encoding, automatic localization, spatial disentanglement of triplane features, and fusion learning to achieve the desired edits. We demonstrate how our approach excels across diverse domains, including human faces, 360-degree heads, animal faces, partially stylized edits like cartoon faces, full-body clothing edits, and edits on class-agnostic samples.

Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have re-emerged as powerful alternatives, leveraging next-token generation to match diffusion models. However, existing editing techniques designed for diffusion models fail to translate directly to AR models due to fundamental differences in structural control. Specifically, AR models suffer from spatial poverty of attention maps and sequential accumulation of structural errors during image editing, which disrupt object layouts and global consistency. In this work, we introduce Implicit Structure Locking (ISLock), the first training-free editing strategy for AR visual models. Rather than relying on explicit attention manipulation or fine-tuning, ISLock preserves structural blueprints by dynamically aligning self-attention patterns with reference images through the Anchor Token Matching (ATM) protocol. By implicitly enforcing structural consistency in latent space, our method ISLock enables structure-aware editing while maintaining generative autonomy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ISLock achieves high-quality, structure-consistent edits without additional training and is superior or comparable to conventional editing techniques. Our findings pioneer the way for efficient and flexible AR-based image editing, further bridging the performance gap between diffusion and autoregressive generative models. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hutaiHang/ATM</p></details> |  |

However, existing models still fail to perform local edits, follow detailed editing prompts, or maintain global image quality beyond a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and improves image quality consistently during more than 100 editing steps. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. SPICE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a challenging realistic image-editing dataset consisting of semantic editing (object addition, removal, replacement, and background change), stylistic editing (texture changes), and structural editing (action change) tasks. Not only does SPICE achieve the highest quantitative performance according to standard evaluation metrics, but it is also consistently preferred by users over existing image-editing methods. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 21 figures.

We propose a novel framework CoProSketch, providing prominent controllability and details for sketch generation with diffusion models. A straightforward method is fine-tuning a pretrained image generation diffusion model with binarized sketch images. However, we find that the diffusion models fail to generate clear binary images, which makes the produced sketches chaotic. We thus propose to represent the sketches by unsigned distance field (UDF), which is continuous and can be easily decoded to sketches through a lightweight network. With CoProSketch, users generate a rough sketch from a bounding box and a text prompt. The rough sketch can be manually edited and fed back into the model for iterative refinement and will be decoded to a detailed sketch as the final result. Additionally, we curate the first large-scale text-sketch paired dataset as the training data. Experiments demonstrate superior semantic consistency and controllability over baselines, offering a practical solution for integrating user feedback into generative workflows.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Beyond generation, object-level image editing remains a challenging problem, requiring precise modifications while preserving visual coherence. Existing text-based instructional editing methods struggle with localized shape and layout transformations, often introducing unintended global changes. Image interaction-based approaches offer better accuracy but require manual human effort to provide precise guidance. To reduce this manual effort while maintaining a high image editing accuracy, in this paper, we propose POEM, a framework for Precise Object-level Editing using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). POEM leverages MLLMs to analyze instructional prompts and generate precise object masks before and after transformation, enabling fine-grained control without extensive user input. This structured reasoning stage guides the diffusion-based editing process, ensuring accurate object localization and transformation. To evaluate our approach, we introduce VOCEdits, a benchmark dataset based on PASCAL VOC 2012, augmented with instructional edit prompts, ground-truth transformations, and precise object masks. Experimental results show that POEM outperforms existing text-based image editing approaches in precision and reliability while reducing manual effort compared to interaction-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SCIA 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Marmot, a novel and generalizable framework that employs Multi-Agent Reasoning for Multi-Object Self-Correcting, enhancing image-text alignment and facilitating more coherent multi-object image editing. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the self-correction task into three critical dimensions (counting, attributes, and spatial relationships), and further divided into object-level subtasks. We construct a multi-agent editing system featuring a decision-execution-verification mechanism, effectively mitigating inter-object interference and enhancing editing reliability. To resolve the problem of subtask integration, we propose a Pixel-Domain Stitching Smoother that employs mask-guided two-stage latent space optimization. This innovation enables parallel processing of subtask results, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency while eliminating multi-stage distortion accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Marmot significantly improves accuracy in object counting, attribute assignment, and spatial relationships for image generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Universal Features for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07462v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, advanced image editing and generation methods have rapidly evolved, making detecting and locating forged image content increasingly challenging. Most existing image forgery detection methods rely on identifying the edited traces left in the image. However, because the traces of different forgeries are distinct, these methods can identify familiar forgeries included in the training data but struggle to handle unseen ones. In response, we present an approach for Generalizable Image Forgery Localization (GIFL). Once trained, our model can detect both seen and unseen forgeries, providing a more practical and efficient solution to counter false information in the era of generative AI. Our method focuses on learning general features from the pristine content rather than traces of specific forgeries, which are relatively consistent across different types of forgeries and therefore can be used as universal features to locate unseen forgeries. Additionally, as existing image forgery datasets are still dominated by traditional hand-crafted forgeries, we construct a new dataset consisting of images edited by various popular deep generative image editing methods to further encourage research in detecting images manipulated by deep generative models.

| **[Routing to the Right Expertise: A Trustworthy Judge for Instruction-based Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07424v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based Image Editing (IIE) models have made significantly improvement due to the progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, which can understand and reason about complex editing instructions. In addition to advancing current IIE models, accurately evaluating their output has become increasingly critical and challenging. Current IIE evaluation methods and their evaluation procedures often fall short of aligning with human judgment and often lack explainability. To address these limitations, we propose JUdgement through Routing of Expertise (JURE). Each expert in JURE is a pre-selected model assumed to be equipped with an atomic expertise that can provide useful feedback to judge output, and the router dynamically routes the evaluation task of a given instruction and its output to appropriate experts, aggregating their feedback into a final judge. JURE is trustworthy in two aspects. First, it can effortlessly provide explanations about its judge by examining the routed experts and their feedback. Second, experimental results demonstrate that JURE is reliable by achieving superior alignment with human judgments, setting a new standard for automated IIE evaluation. Moreover, JURE's flexible design is future-proof - modular experts can be seamlessly replaced or expanded to accommodate advancements in IIE, maintaining consistently high evaluation quality. Our evaluation data and results are available at https://github.com/Cyyyyyrus/JURE.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer between Modalities with MetaQueries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06256v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding (text output) and generation (pixel output), but aligning these different modalities within a single architecture often demands complex training recipes and careful data balancing. We introduce MetaQueries, a set of learnable queries that act as an efficient interface between autoregressive multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models. MetaQueries connects the MLLM's latents to the diffusion decoder, enabling knowledge-augmented image generation by leveraging the MLLM's deep understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our method simplifies training, requiring only paired image-caption data and standard diffusion objectives. Notably, this transfer is effective even when the MLLM backbone remains frozen, thereby preserving its state-of-the-art multimodal understanding capabilities while achieving strong generative performance. Additionally, our method is flexible and can be easily instruction-tuned for advanced applications such as image editing and subject-driven generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://xichenpan.com/metaquery</p></details> |
| **[Tuning-Free Image Editing with Fidelity and Editability via Unified Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05594v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balancing fidelity and editability is essential in text-based image editing (TIE), where failures commonly lead to over- or under-editing issues. Existing methods typically rely on attention injections for structure preservation and leverage the inherent text alignment capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models for editability, but they lack explicit and unified mechanisms to properly balance these two objectives. In this work, we introduce UnifyEdit, a tuning-free method that performs diffusion latent optimization to enable a balanced integration of fidelity and editability within a unified framework. Unlike direct attention injections, we develop two attention-based constraints: a self-attention (SA) preservation constraint for structural fidelity, and a cross-attention (CA) alignment constraint to enhance text alignment for improved editability. However, simultaneously applying both constraints can lead to gradient conflicts, where the dominance of one constraint results in over- or under-editing. To address this challenge, we introduce an adaptive time-step scheduler that dynamically adjusts the influence of these constraints, guiding the diffusion latent toward an optimal balance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority in achieving a robust balance between structure preservation and text alignment across various editing tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Unlike conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications, creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration, generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project URL: https://crea-diffusion.github.io</p></details> |

| **[Disentangling Instruction Influence in Diffusion Transformers for Parallel Multi-Instruction-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04784v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-guided image editing enables users to specify modifications using natural language, offering more flexibility and control. Among existing frameworks, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) outperform U-Net-based diffusion models in scalability and performance. However, while real-world scenarios often require concurrent execution of multiple instructions, step-by-step editing suffers from accumulated errors and degraded quality, and integrating multiple instructions with a single prompt usually results in incomplete edits due to instruction conflicts. We propose Instruction Influence Disentanglement (IID), a novel framework enabling parallel execution of multiple instructions in a single denoising process, designed for DiT-based models. By analyzing self-attention mechanisms in DiTs, we identify distinctive attention patterns in multi-instruction settings and derive instruction-specific attention masks to disentangle each instruction's influence. These masks guide the editing process to ensure localized modifications while preserving consistency in non-edited regions. Extensive experiments on open-source and custom datasets demonstrate that IID reduces diffusion steps while improving fidelity and instruction completion compared to existing baselines. The codes will be publicly released upon the acceptance of the paper.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, and is capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results.

| **[Long-horizon Visual Instruction Generation with Logic and Attribute Self-reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13500v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual instructions for long-horizon tasks are crucial as they intuitively clarify complex concepts and enhance retention across extended steps. Directly generating a series of images using text-to-image models without considering the context of previous steps results in inconsistent images, increasing cognitive load. Additionally, the generated images often miss objects or the attributes such as color, shape, and state of the objects are inaccurate. To address these challenges, we propose LIGER, the first training-free framework for Long-horizon Instruction GEneration with logic and attribute self-Reflection. LIGER first generates a draft image for each step with the historical prompt and visual memory of previous steps. This step-by-step generation approach maintains consistency between images in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, LIGER utilizes various image editing tools to rectify errors including wrong attributes, logic errors, object redundancy, and identity inconsistency in the draft images. Through this self-reflection mechanism, LIGER improves the logic and object attribute correctness of the images. To verify whether the generated images assist human understanding, we manually curated a new benchmark consisting of various long-horizon tasks. Human-annotated ground truth expressions reflect the human-defined criteria for how an image should appear to be illustrative. Experiments demonstrate the visual instructions generated by LIGER are more comprehensive compared with baseline methods.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Despite this, minimal research has focused on negation within text-guided image editing. This lack of research means that vision-language models (VLMs) for image editing may struggle to understand negation, implying that they struggle to provide accurate results. One barrier to achieving human-level intelligence is the lack of a standard collection by which research into negation can be evaluated. This paper presents the first large-scale dataset, Negative Instruction (NeIn), for studying negation within instruction-based image editing. Our dataset comprises 366,957 quintuplets, i.e., source image, original caption, selected object, negative sentence, and target image in total, including 342,775 queries for training and 24,182 queries for benchmarking image editing methods. Specifically, we automatically generate NeIn based on a large, existing vision-language dataset, MS-COCO, via two steps: generation and filtering. During the generation phase, we leverage two VLMs, BLIP and InstructPix2Pix (fine-tuned on MagicBrush dataset), to generate NeIn's samples and the negative clauses that expresses the content of the source image. In the subsequent filtering phase, we apply BLIP and LLaVA-NeXT to remove erroneous samples. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation protocol to assess the negation understanding for image editing models. Extensive experiments using our dataset across multiple VLMs for text-guided image editing demonstrate that even recent state-of-the-art VLMs struggle to understand negative queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop SyntaGen.

But editing pattern images is tricky: desired edits are often programmatic: structure-aware edits that alter the underlying program which generates the pattern. One could attempt to infer this underlying program, but current methods for doing so struggle with complex images and produce unorganized programs that make editing tedious. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to perform programmatic edits on pattern images. By using a pattern analogy -- a pair of simple patterns to demonstrate the intended edit -- and a learning-based generative model to execute these edits, our method allows users to intuitively edit patterns. To enable this paradigm, we introduce SplitWeave, a domain-specific language that, combined with a framework for sampling synthetic pattern analogies, enables the creation of a large, high-quality synthetic training dataset. We also present TriFuser, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) designed to overcome critical issues that arise when naively deploying LDMs to this task. Extensive experiments on real-world, artist-sourced patterns reveals that our method faithfully performs the demonstrated edit while also generalizing to related pattern styles beyond its training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 - Website: https://bardofcodes.github.io/patterns/</p></details> |

While previous studies have focused on the bottleneck layer (h-space), cross-attention, self-attention, and decoding layers, the overall role of the skip connections of the U-Net itself has not been specifically addressed. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style, passed by the remaining stream in the opposed decoding layer. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our method, SkipInject, to state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR Workshop on AI for Creative Visual Content Generation Editing and Understanding 2025</p></details> |

We propose a new algorithm based on lattice structures to automatically synthesize object selection predicates for image editing from positive and negative examples. By leveraging the algebraic properties of lattices, our algorithm efficiently synthesizes an optimal object selection predicate among multiple correct solutions. We have implemented our technique and evaluated it on 100 tasks over 20 images.

The model preserves the dual paradigm of next-token prediction for visual understanding and next-scale generation for image synthesis. Specifically, VARGPT-v1.1 integrates: (1) a novel training strategy combining iterative visual instruction tuning with reinforcement learning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), (2) an expanded training corpus containing 8.3M visual-generative instruction pairs, (3) an upgraded language model backbone using Qwen2, (4) enhanced image generation resolution, and (5) emergent image editing capabilities without architectural modifications. These advancements enable VARGPT-v1.1 to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in both comprehension and generation metrics. Notably, through visual instruction tuning, the model acquires image editing functionality while maintaining architectural consistency with its predecessor, revealing the potential for unified visual understanding, generation, and editing. Our findings suggest that well-designed unified visual autoregressive models can effectively adopt flexible training strategies from large language models (LLMs), exhibiting promising scalability.

Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the three fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation, and editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image discretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind specialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this, LaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle with image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series decouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities to seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In contrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which preserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling a coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and generation. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer for enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows a continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a progressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the vision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible and efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks. ILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs and specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and versatile foundation for future multimodal applications. Project Page: https://illume-unified-mllm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

This scaling mechanism implicitly defines a ``scaling space'' whose potential for fine-grained semantic manipulation remains underexplored. We investigate this space, starting with inversion-based editing where the difference between conditional/unconditional noise predictions carries key semantic information. Our core contribution stems from a Fourier analysis of noise predictions, revealing that its low- and high-frequency components evolve differently throughout diffusion. Based on this insight, we introduce FreSca, a straightforward method that applies guidance scaling independently to different frequency bands in the Fourier domain. FreSca demonstrably enhances existing image editing methods without retraining. Excitingly, its effectiveness extends to image understanding tasks such as depth estimation, yielding quantitative gains across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wikichao.github.io/FreSca/</p></details> |

Especially for real-world images, the occlusion situation further increases the difficulty. The main difficulty is that the occluded portion needs to be completed before movement can proceed. To leverage the real-world knowledge embedded in the pre-trained diffusion models, we propose a Diffusion-based framework specifically designed for Occluded Object Movement, named DiffOOM. The proposed DiffOOM consists of two parallel branches that perform object de-occlusion and movement simultaneously. The de-occlusion branch utilizes a background color-fill strategy and a continuously updated object mask to focus the diffusion process on completing the obscured portion of the target object. Concurrently, the movement branch employs latent optimization to place the completed object in the target location and adopts local text-conditioned guidance to integrate the object into new surroundings appropriately. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which is further validated by a comprehensive user study.</p></details> |  |

| **[Training-Free Text-Guided Image Editing with Visual Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23897v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing is an essential task that enables users to modify images through natural language descriptions. Recent advances in diffusion models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality, primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token reassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity, fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Such success inspires many efforts trying to use large-scale pre-trained diffusion models for tackling a challenging problem--real image editing. Works conducted in this area learn a unique textual token corresponding to several images containing the same object. However, under many circumstances, only one image is available, such as the painting of the Girl with a Pearl Earring. Using existing works on fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models with a single image causes severe overfitting issues. The information leakage from the pre-trained diffusion models makes editing can not keep the same content as the given image while creating new features depicted by the language guidance. This work aims to address the problem of single-image editing. We propose a novel model-based guidance built upon the classifier-free guidance so that the knowledge from the model trained on a single image can be distilled into the pre-trained diffusion model, enabling content creation even with one given image. Additionally, we propose a patch-based fine-tuning that can effectively help the model generate images of arbitrary resolution. We provide extensive experiments to validate the design choices of our approach and show promising editing capabilities, including changing style, content addition, and object manipulation.

In this work, we are the first to investigate the question: 'Can fine-tuned foundation models help identify critical, and possibly unknown, data properties?' By evaluating our proposed method on a chest x-ray dataset, we show that these models can generate high-resolution, precisely edited images compared to methods that rely on Structural Causal Models (SCMs) according to numerous metrics. For the first time, we demonstrate that fine-tuned VLMs can reveal hidden data relationships that were previously obscured due to available metadata granularity and model capacity limitations. Our experiments demonstrate both the potential of these models to reveal underlying dataset properties while also exposing the limitations of fine-tuned VLMs for accurate image editing and susceptibility to biases and spurious correlations.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency.

However, current models in this domain often struggle to accurately execute complex user instructions, as they are trained on low-quality data with limited editing types. We present AnyEdit, a comprehensive multi-modal instruction editing dataset, comprising 2.5 million high-quality editing pairs spanning over 20 editing types and five domains. We ensure the diversity and quality of the AnyEdit collection through three aspects: initial data diversity, adaptive editing process, and automated selection of editing results. Using the dataset, we further train a novel AnyEdit Stable Diffusion with task-aware routing and learnable task embedding for unified image editing. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that AnyEdit consistently boosts the performance of diffusion-based editing models. This presents prospects for developing instruction-driven image editing models that support human creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[LOCATEdit: Graph Laplacian Optimized Cross Attention for Localized Text-Guided Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21541v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing aims to modify specific regions of an image according to natural language instructions while maintaining the general structure and the background fidelity. Existing methods utilize masks derived from cross-attention maps generated from diffusion models to identify the target regions for modification. However, since cross-attention mechanisms focus on semantic relevance, they struggle to maintain the image integrity. As a result, these methods often lack spatial consistency, leading to editing artifacts and distortions. In this work, we address these limitations and introduce LOCATEdit, which enhances cross-attention maps through a graph-based approach utilizing self-attention-derived patch relationships to maintain smooth, coherent attention across image regions, ensuring that alterations are limited to the designated items while retaining the surrounding structure. LOCATEdit consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on PIE-Bench, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness on various editing tasks.

| **[Follow Your Motion: A Generic Temporal Consistency Portrait Editing Framework with Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22225v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained conditional diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable potential in image editing. However, they often face challenges with temporal consistency, particularly in the talking head domain, where continuous changes in facial expressions intensify the level of difficulty. These issues stem from the independent editing of individual images and the inherent loss of temporal continuity during the editing process. In this paper, we introduce Follow Your Motion (FYM), a generic framework for maintaining temporal consistency in portrait editing. Specifically, given portrait images rendered by a pre-trained 3D Gaussian Splatting model, we first develop a diffusion model that intuitively and inherently learns motion trajectory changes at different scales and pixel coordinates, from the first frame to each subsequent frame. This approach ensures that temporally inconsistent edited avatars inherit the motion information from the rendered avatars. Secondly, to maintain fine-grained expression temporal consistency in talking head editing, we propose a dynamic re-weighted attention mechanism. This mechanism assigns higher weight coefficients to landmark points in space and dynamically updates these weights based on landmark loss, achieving more consistent and refined facial expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of temporal consistency and can be used to optimize and compensate for temporally inconsistent outputs in a range of applications, such as text-driven editing, relighting, and various other applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://anonymous-hub1127.github.io/FYM.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Motion Prompting: Controlling Video Generation with Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02700v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion control is crucial for generating expressive and compelling video content; however, most existing video generation models rely mainly on text prompts for control, which struggle to capture the nuances of dynamic actions and temporal compositions. To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

| **[VIA: Unified Spatiotemporal Video Adaptation Framework for Global and Local Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12831v3)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video editing serves as a fundamental pillar of digital media, spanning applications in entertainment, education, and professional communication. However, previous methods often overlook the necessity of comprehensively understanding both global and local contexts, leading to inaccurate and inconsistent edits in the spatiotemporal dimension, especially for long videos. In this paper, we introduce VIA, a unified spatiotemporal Video Adaptation framework for global and local video editing, pushing the limits of consistently editing minute-long videos. First, to ensure local consistency within individual frames, we designed test-time editing adaptation to adapt a pre-trained image editing model for improving consistency between potential editing directions and the text instruction, and adapts masked latent variables for precise local control. Furthermore, to maintain global consistency over the video sequence, we introduce spatiotemporal adaptation that recursively gather consistent attention variables in key frames and strategically applies them across the whole sequence to realize the editing effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to baseline methods, our VIA approach produces edits that are more faithful to the source videos, more coherent in the spatiotemporal context, and more precise in local control. More importantly, we show that VIA can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes, unlocking the potential for advanced video editing tasks over long video sequences.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Recent methods have shown promising composition editing results in the image setting, but in the video setting, editing methods have focused on editing object's appearance and motion, or camera motion, and as a result, methods to edit object composition in videos are still missing. We propose \name as a method for editing 3D object compositions in videos of static scenes with camera motion. Our approach allows editing the 3D position of a 3D object across all frames of a video in a temporally consistent manner. This is achieved by lifting intermediate features of a generative model to a 3D reconstruction that is shared between all frames, editing the reconstruction, and projecting the features on the edited reconstruction back to each frame. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative approach to edit object compositions in videos. Our approach is simple and training-free, while outperforming state-of-the-art image editing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://videohandles.github.io</p></details> |

Yet at the same time, the vast majority of media edits are harmless -- such as a filtered vacation photo. The difference between this example, and harmful edits that spread disinformation, is one of intent. Recognizing and describing this intent is a major challenge for today's AI systems. We present the task of Edited Media Understanding, requiring models to answer open-ended questions that capture the intent and implications of an image edit. We introduce a dataset for our task, EMU, with 48k question-answer pairs written in rich natural language. We evaluate a wide variety of vision-and-language models for our task, and introduce a new model PELICAN, which builds upon recent progress in pretrained multimodal representations. Our model obtains promising results on our dataset, with humans rating its answers as accurate 40.35% of the time. At the same time, there is still much work to be done -- humans prefer human-annotated captions 93.56% of the time -- and we provide analysis that highlights areas for further progress.</p></details> | ACL 2021 |
| **[EditCLIP: Representation Learning for Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20318v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce EditCLIP, a novel representation-learning approach for image editing. Our method learns a unified representation of edits by jointly encoding an input image and its edited counterpart, effectively capturing their transformation. To evaluate its effectiveness, we employ EditCLIP to solve two tasks: exemplar-based image editing and automated edit evaluation. In exemplar-based image editing, we replace text-based instructions in InstructPix2Pix with EditCLIP embeddings computed from a reference exemplar image pair. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being more efficient and versatile. For automated evaluation, EditCLIP assesses image edits by measuring the similarity between the EditCLIP embedding of a given image pair and either a textual editing instruction or the EditCLIP embedding of another reference image pair. Experiments show that EditCLIP aligns more closely with human judgments than existing CLIP-based metrics, providing a reliable measure of edit quality and structural preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qianwangx.github.io/EditCLIP/</p></details> |

However, the prevailing diffusion inversion performs deficiently in flow-based models, and the invariance control cannot reconcile diverse rigid and non-rigid editing tasks. To address these, we systematically analyze the \textbf{inversion and invariance} control based on the flow transformer. Specifically, we unveil that the Euler inversion shares a similar structure to DDIM yet is more susceptible to the approximation error. Thus, we propose a two-stage inversion to first refine the velocity estimation and then compensate for the leftover error, which pivots closely to the model prior and benefits editing. Meanwhile, we propose the invariance control that manipulates the text features within the adaptive layer normalization, connecting the changes in the text prompt to image semantics. This mechanism can simultaneously preserve the non-target contents while allowing rigid and non-rigid manipulation, enabling a wide range of editing types such as visual text, quantity, facial expression, etc. Experiments on versatile scenarios validate that our framework achieves flexible and accurate editing, unlocking the potential of the flow transformer for versatile image editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Page: https://pengchengpcx.github.io/EditFT/</p></details> |

To do this, previous approaches have typically relied on text-to-image (T2I) generative models to produce pairs of original and edited images that simulate the input/output of an instruction-guided image-editing model. However, these image pairs often fail to align with the specified edit instructions due to the limitations of T2I models, which negatively impacts models trained on such datasets. To address this, we present Instruct-CLIP (I-CLIP), a selfsupervised method that learns the semantic changes between original and edited images to refine and better align the instructions in existing datasets. Furthermore, we adapt Instruct-CLIP to handle noisy latent images and diffusion timesteps so that it can be used to train latent diffusion models (LDMs) and efficiently enforce alignment between the edit instruction and the image changes in latent space at any step of the diffusion pipeline. We use Instruct-CLIP to correct the InstructPix2Pix dataset and get over 120K refined samples we then use to fine-tune their model, guided by our novel I-CLIP-based loss function. The resulting model can produce edits that are more aligned with the given instructions.

However, SDS often suffers from blurriness caused by noisy gradients. When SDS meets the image editing, such degradations can be reduced by adjusting bias shifts using reference pairs, but the de-biasing techniques are still corrupted by erroneous gradients. To this end, we introduce Identity-preserving Distillation Sampling (IDS), which compensates for the gradient leading to undesired changes in the results. Based on the analysis that these errors come from the text-conditioned scores, a new regularization technique, called fixed-point iterative regularization (FPR), is proposed to modify the score itself, driving the preservation of the identity even including poses and structures. Thanks to a self-correction by FPR, the proposed method provides clear and unambiguous representations corresponding to the given prompts in image-to-image editing and editable neural radiance field (NeRF). The structural consistency between the source and the edited data is obviously maintained compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FDS: Frequency-Aware Denoising Score for Text-Guided Latent Diffusion Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19191v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image editing using Text-to-Image (T2I) models often fails to yield satisfactory results, frequently introducing unintended modifications, such as the loss of local detail and color changes. In this paper, we analyze these failure cases and attribute them to the indiscriminate optimization across all frequency bands, even though only specific frequencies may require adjustment. To address this, we introduce a simple yet effective approach that enables the selective optimization of specific frequency bands within localized spatial regions for precise edits. Our method leverages wavelets to decompose images into different spatial resolutions across multiple frequency bands, enabling precise modifications at various levels of detail. To extend the applicability of our approach, we provide a comparative analysis of different frequency-domain techniques. Additionally, we extend our method to 3D texture editing by performing frequency decomposition on the triplane representation, enabling frequency-aware adjustments for 3D textures. Quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality and precise edits.</p></details> | 8 pages (main paper) |

| **[CAMeL: Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18782v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jahawn-Wen/CAMeL-reID.</p></details> |  |
| **[TVPR: Text-to-Video Person Retrieval and a New Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07184v3)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing methods for text-based person retrieval focus on text-to-image person retrieval. Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset. The TVPReid dataset will be publicly available to benefit future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia</p></details> |
| **[UP-Person: Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10084v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) as a multi-modal task, which aims to retrieve the target person from a pool of candidate images given a text description, has recently garnered considerable attention due to the progress of contrastive visual-language pre-trained model. Prior works leverage pre-trained CLIP to extract person visual and textual features and fully fine-tune the entire network, which have shown notable performance improvements compared to uni-modal pre-training models. However, full-tuning a large model is prone to overfitting and hinders the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a novel Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) method for Text-based Person Retrieval (UP-Person) to thoroughly transfer the multi-modal knowledge from CLIP. Specifically, UP-Person simultaneously integrates three lightweight PETL components including Prefix, LoRA and Adapter, where Prefix and LoRA are devised together to mine local information with task-specific information prompts, and Adapter is designed to adjust global feature representations. Additionally, two vanilla submodules are optimized to adapt to the unified architecture of TPR. For one thing, S-Prefix is proposed to boost attention of prefix and enhance the gradient propagation of prefix tokens, which improves the flexibility and performance of the vanilla prefix. For another thing, L-Adapter is designed in parallel with layer normalization to adjust the overall distribution, which can resolve conflicts caused by overlap and interaction among multiple submodules. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our UP-Person achieves state-of-the-art results across various person retrieval datasets, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid while merely fine-tuning 4.7\% parameters.

| **[An Empirical Study of Validating Synthetic Data for Text-Based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22171v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data plays a pivotal role in Text-Based Person Retrieval (TBPR) research. Mainstream research paradigm necessitates real-world person images with manual textual annotations for training models, posing privacy-sensitive and labor-intensive issues. Several pioneering efforts explore synthetic data for TBPR but still rely on real data, keeping the aforementioned issues and also resulting in diversity-deficient issue in synthetic datasets, thus impacting TBPR performance. Moreover, these works tend to explore synthetic data for TBPR through limited perspectives, leading to exploration-restricted issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of synthetic data for TBPR, highlighting three key aspects. (1) We propose an inter-class image generation pipeline, in which an automatic prompt construction strategy is introduced to guide generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in generating various inter-class images without reliance on original data. (2) We develop an intra-class image augmentation pipeline, in which the generative AI models are applied to further edit the images for obtaining various intra-class images. (3) Building upon the proposed pipelines and an automatic text generation pipeline, we explore the effectiveness of synthetic data in diverse scenarios through extensive experiments. Additionally, we experimentally investigate various noise-robust learning strategies to mitigate the inherent noise in synthetic data. We will release the code, along with the synthetic large-scale dataset generated by our pipelines, which are expected to advance practical TBPR research.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures |

Tailoring CLIP to person domain is now a emerging research topic due to the abundant knowledge of vision-language pretraining, but challenges still remain during fine-tuning: (i) Previous full-model fine-tuning in TPR is computationally expensive and prone to overfitting.(ii) Existing parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) for TPR lacks of fine-grained feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose Domain-Aware Mixture-of-Adapters (DM-Adapter), which unifies Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) and PETL to enhance fine-grained feature representations while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, Sparse Mixture-of-Adapters is designed in parallel to MLP layers in both vision and language branches, where different experts specialize in distinct aspects of person knowledge to handle features more finely. To promote the router to exploit domain information effectively and alleviate the routing imbalance, Domain-Aware Router is then developed by building a novel gating function and injecting learnable domain-aware prompts. Extensive experiments show that our DM-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-path Exploration and Feedback Adjustment for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21318v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval aims to identify the specific persons using textual descriptions as queries. Existing ad vanced methods typically depend on vision-language pre trained (VLP) models to facilitate effective cross-modal alignment. However, the inherent constraints of VLP mod-els, which include the global alignment biases and insuffi-cient self-feedback regulation, impede optimal retrieval per formance. In this paper, we propose MeFa, a Multi-Pathway Exploration, Feedback, and Adjustment framework, which deeply explores intrinsic feedback of intra and inter-modal to make targeted adjustment, thereby achieving more precise person-text associations. Specifically, we first design an intra modal reasoning pathway that generates hard negative sam ples for cross-modal data, leveraging feedback from these samples to refine intra-modal reasoning, thereby enhancing sensitivity to subtle discrepancies. Subsequently, we intro duce a cross-modal refinement pathway that utilizes both global information and intermodal feedback to refine local in formation, thus enhancing its global semantic representation. Finally, the discriminative clue correction pathway incorpo rates fine-grained features of secondary similarity as discrim inative clues to further mitigate retrieval failures caused by disparities in these features. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that MeFa achieves superior person retrieval performance without necessitating additional data or complex structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beat: Bi-directional One-to-Many Embedding Alignment for Text-based Person Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05620v1)** | 2024-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person retrieval (TPR) is a challenging task that involves retrieving a specific individual based on a textual description. Despite considerable efforts to bridge the gap between vision and language, the significant differences between these modalities continue to pose a challenge. Previous methods have attempted to align text and image samples in a modal-shared space, but they face uncertainties in optimization directions due to the movable features of both modalities and the failure to account for one-to-many relationships of image-text pairs in TPR datasets. To address this issue, we propose an effective bi-directional one-to-many embedding paradigm that offers a clear optimization direction for each sample, thus mitigating the optimization problem. Additionally, this embedding scheme generates multiple features for each sample without introducing trainable parameters, making it easier to align with several positive samples. Based on this paradigm, we propose a novel Bi-directional one-to-many Embedding Alignment (Beat) model to address the TPR task. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Beat model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular TPR datasets, including CUHK-PEDES (65.61 R@1), ICFG-PEDES (58.25 R@1), and RSTPReID (48.10 R@1). Furthermore, additional experiments on MS-COCO, CUB, and Flowers datasets further demonstrate the potential of Beat to be applied to other image-text retrieval tasks.</p></details> | ACM MM2023 |

This hinders the model to comprehend the fine-grained semantics of query texts in real scenarios. To address this problem, we contribute a new benchmark named \textbf{UFineBench} for text-based person retrieval with ultra-fine granularity. Firstly, we construct a new \textbf{dataset} named UFine6926. We collect a large number of person images and manually annotate each image with two detailed textual descriptions, averaging 80.8 words each. The average word count is three to four times that of the previous datasets. In addition of standard in-domain evaluation, we also propose a special \textbf{evaluation paradigm} more representative of real scenarios. It contains a new evaluation set with cross domains, cross textual granularity and cross textual styles, named UFine3C, and a new evaluation metric for accurately measuring retrieval ability, named mean Similarity Distribution (mSD). Moreover, we propose CFAM, a more efficient \textbf{algorithm} especially designed for text-based person retrieval with ultra fine-grained texts. It achieves fine granularity mining by adopting a shared cross-modal granularity decoder and hard negative match mechanism. With standard in-domain evaluation, CFAM establishes competitive performance across various datasets, especially on our ultra fine-grained UFine6926. Furthermore, by evaluating on UFine3C, we demonstrate that training on our UFine6926 significantly improves generalization to real scenarios compared with other coarse-grained datasets. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Zplusdragon/UFineBench}.</p></details> |  |

It supports multimodal tasks, including text-based person retrieval and human matching. One of the most significant challenges faced in Re-ID is clothes-changing, where the same person may appear in different outfits. While previous methods have made notable progress in maintaining clothing data consistency and handling clothing change data, they still rely excessively on clothing information, which can limit performance due to the dynamic nature of human appearances. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Pose-Guidance Deep Supervision (PGDS), an effective framework for learning pose guidance within the Re-ID task. It consists of three modules: a human encoder, a pose encoder, and a Pose-to-Human Projection module (PHP). Our framework guides the human encoder, i.e., the main re-identification model, with pose information from the pose encoder through multiple layers via the knowledge transfer mechanism from the PHP module, helping the human encoder learn body parts information without increasing computation resources in the inference stage. Through extensive experiments, our method surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness for real-world applications.

The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training. However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets. This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR. LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information. In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training.

To close the gap, we study the problem of text-based person search in full images by proposing a new end-to-end learning framework which jointly optimize the pedestrian detection, identification and visual-semantic feature embedding tasks. To take full advantage of the query text, the semantic features are leveraged to instruct the Region Proposal Network to pay more attention to the text-described proposals. Besides, a cross-scale visual-semantic embedding mechanism is utilized to improve the performance. To validate the proposed method, we collect and annotate two large-scale benchmark datasets based on the widely adopted image-based person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets and compared with the baseline methods, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge lies in bridging the substantial gap between vision and language modalities, especially when dealing with limited large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a CLIP-based Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (CSKT) approach for TPR. Specifically, to explore the CLIP's knowledge on input side, we first propose a Bidirectional Prompts Transferring (BPT) module constructed by text-to-image and image-to-text bidirectional prompts and coupling projections. Secondly, Dual Adapters Transferring (DAT) is designed to transfer knowledge on output side of Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in vision and language. This synergistic two-way collaborative mechanism promotes the early-stage feature fusion and efficiently exploits the existing knowledge of CLIP. CSKT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches across three benchmark datasets when the training parameters merely account for 7.4% of the entire model, demonstrating its remarkable efficiency, effectiveness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP2024(accepted). minor typos revision compared to version 1 in arxiv</p></details> |
| **[Prototype-Guided Text-based Person Search based on Rich Chinese Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14834v1)** | 2023-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based person search aims to simultaneously localize and identify the target person based on query text from uncropped scene images, which can be regarded as the unified task of person detection and text-based person retrieval task. In this work, we propose a large-scale benchmark dataset named PRW-TPS-CN based on the widely used person search dataset PRW. Our dataset contains 47,102 sentences, which means there is quite more information than existing dataset. These texts precisely describe the person images from top to bottom, which in line with the natural description order. We also provide both Chinese and English descriptions in our dataset for more comprehensive evaluation. These characteristics make our dataset more applicable. To alleviate the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval, we take advantage of the rich texts in PRW-TPS-CN dataset. We propose to aggregate multiple texts as text prototypes to maintain the prominent text features of a person, which can better reflect the whole character of a person. The overall prototypes lead to generating the image attention map to eliminate the detection misalignment causing the decrease of text-based person retrieval. Thus, the inconsistency between person detection and text-based person retrieval is largely alleviated. We conduct extensive experiments on the PRW-TPS-CN dataset. The experimental results show the PRW-TPS-CN dataset's effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

In particular, MALS contains 1,510,330 image-text pairs, which is about 37.5 times larger than prevailing CUHK-PEDES, and all images are annotated with 27 attributes. Considering the privacy concerns and annotation costs, we leverage the off-the-shelf diffusion models to generate the dataset. To verify the feasibility of learning from the generated data, we develop a new joint Attribute Prompt Learning and Text Matching Learning (APTM) framework, considering the shared knowledge between attribute and text. As the name implies, APTM contains an attribute prompt learning stream and a text matching learning stream. (1) The attribute prompt learning leverages the attribute prompts for image-attribute alignment, which enhances the text matching learning. (2) The text matching learning facilitates the representation learning on fine-grained details, and in turn, boosts the attribute prompt learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the pre-training on MALS, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance via APTM on three challenging real-world benchmarks. In particular, APTM achieves a consistent improvement of +6.96%, +7.68%, and +16.95% Recall@1 accuracy on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets by a clear margin, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Many previous approaches contrive to learning a latent common manifold mapping paradigm following a \textbf{cross-modal distribution consensus prediction (CDCP)} manner. When mapping features from distribution of one certain modality into the common manifold, feature distribution of the opposite modality is completely invisible. That is to say, how to achieve a cross-modal distribution consensus so as to embed and align the multi-modal features in a constructed cross-modal common manifold all depends on the experience of the model itself, instead of the actual situation. With such methods, it is inevitable that the multi-modal data can not be well aligned in the common manifold, which finally leads to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To overcome this \textbf{CDCP dilemma}, we propose a novel algorithm termed LBUL to learn a Consistent Cross-modal Common Manifold (C$^{3}$M) for text-based person retrieval. The core idea of our method, just as a Chinese saying goes, is to `\textit{san si er hou xing}', namely, to \textbf{Look Before yoU Leap (LBUL)}. The common manifold mapping mechanism of LBUL contains a looking step and a leaping step. Compared to CDCP-based methods, LBUL considers distribution characteristics of both the visual and textual modalities before embedding data from one certain modality into C$^{3}$M to achieve a more solid cross-modal distribution consensus, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. We evaluate our proposed method on two text-based person retrieval datasets CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LBUL outperforms previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.05773</p></details> |

Existing methods generally face a \textbf{color over-reliance problem}, which means that the models rely heavily on color information when matching cross-modal data. Indeed, color information is an important decision-making accordance for retrieval, but the over-reliance on color would distract the model from other key clues (e.g. texture information, structural information, etc.), and thereby lead to a sub-optimal retrieval performance. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose to \textbf{C}apture \textbf{A}ll-round \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{B}eyond \textbf{C}olor (\textbf{CAIBC}) via a jointly optimized multi-branch architecture for text-based person retrieval. CAIBC contains three branches including an RGB branch, a grayscale (GRS) branch and a color (CLR) branch. Besides, with the aim of making full use of all-round information in a balanced and effective way, a mutual learning mechanism is employed to enable the three branches which attend to varied aspects of information to communicate with and learn from each other. Extensive experimental analysis is carried out to evaluate our proposed CAIBC method on the CUHK-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets in both \textbf{supervised} and \textbf{weakly supervised} text-based person retrieval settings, which demonstrates that CAIBC significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all the three tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ACM MM '22</p></details> |

The key is to learn a common latent space mapping between visual-textual modalities. To achieve this goal, existing works employ segmentation to obtain explicitly cross-modal alignments or utilize attention to explore salient alignments. These methods have two shortcomings: 1) Labeling cross-modal alignments are time-consuming. 2) Attention methods can explore salient cross-modal alignments but may ignore some subtle and valuable pairs. To relieve these issues, we introduce an Implicit Visual-Textual (IVT) framework for text-based person retrieval. Different from previous models, IVT utilizes a single network to learn representation for both modalities, which contributes to the visual-textual interaction. To explore the fine-grained alignment, we further propose two implicit semantic alignment paradigms: multi-level alignment (MLA) and bidirectional mask modeling (BMM). The MLA module explores finer matching at sentence, phrase, and word levels, while the BMM module aims to mine \textbf{more} semantic alignments between visual and textual modalities. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed IVT on public datasets, i.e., CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReID, and ICFG-PEDES. Even without explicit body part alignment, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of high-dimensional data, the unconstrained mapping paradigms are not able to properly catch discriminative clues about the corresponding person while drop the misaligned information. Intuitively, the information contained in visual data can be divided into person information (PI) and surroundings information (SI), which are mutually exclusive from each other. To this end, we propose a novel Deep Surroundings-person Separation Learning (DSSL) model in this paper to effectively extract and match person information, and hence achieve a superior retrieval accuracy. A surroundings-person separation and fusion mechanism plays the key role to realize an accurate and effective surroundings-person separation under a mutually exclusion constraint. In order to adequately utilize multi-modal and multi-granular information for a higher retrieval accuracy, five diverse alignment paradigms are adopted. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed DSSL on CUHK-PEDES, which is currently the only accessible dataset for text-base person retrieval task. DSSL achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CUHK-PEDES. To properly evaluate our proposed DSSL in the real scenarios, a Real Scenarios Text-based Person Reidentification (RSTPReid) dataset is constructed to benefit future research on text-based person retrieval, which will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM'21</p></details> |

In this paper we propose a person retrieval system that uses textual queries (e.g., "black trousers and green shirt") as descriptions and a one-class generative color model with outlier filtering to represent the images both to train the models and to perform the search. The method is evaluated in terms of its efficiency in fulfilling the needs of a forensic retrieval system: limited annotation, robustness, extensibility, adaptability and computational cost. The proposed generative method is compared to a corresponding discriminative approach. Experiments are carried out using a range of queries in three different databases. The experiments show that the two evaluated algorithms provide average retrieval performance and adaptable to new datasets. The proposed generative algorithm has some advantages over the discriminative one, specifically its capability to work with very few training samples and its much lower computational requirements when the number of training examples increases.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multiple Information Prompt Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00330v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person re-identification is a subject closer to the real world, which focuses on solving the problem of person re-identification after pedestrians change clothes. The primary challenge in this field is to overcome the complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to identify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient data collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this problem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice. Current methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the original image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely limited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional model. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel multiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person ReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance of multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS) module is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB image features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The Bio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning intensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP) module is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the impact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID, Celeb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%, 66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively. When compared to AIM (CVPR23), ACID (TIP23), and SCNet (MM23), MIPL achieves rank-1 improvements of 11.3%, 13.8%, and 7.9%, respectively, on the PRCC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Clothes Changing Person ReID: Conflicts, Synthesis, and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12611v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to retrieve images of the same person wearing different outfits. Mainstream researches focus on designing advanced model structures and strategies to capture identity information independent of clothing. However, the same-clothes discrimination as the standard ReID learning objective in CC-ReID is persistently ignored in previous researches. In this study, we dive into the relationship between standard and clothes-changing~(CC) learning objectives, and bring the inner conflicts between these two objectives to the fore. We try to magnify the proportion of CC training pairs by supplementing high-fidelity clothes-varying synthesis, produced by our proposed Clothes-Changing Diffusion model. By incorporating the synthetic images into CC-ReID model training, we observe a significant improvement under CC protocol. However, such improvement sacrifices the performance under the standard protocol, caused by the inner conflict between standard and CC. For conflict mitigation, we decouple these objectives and re-formulate CC-ReID learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. By effectively regularizing the gradient curvature across multiple objectives and introducing preference restrictions, our MOO solution surpasses the single-task training paradigm. Our framework is model-agnostic, and demonstrates superior performance under both CC and standard ReID protocols.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEFF: Improving Any Clothes-Changing Person ReID Model using Gallery Enrichment with Face Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13807v2)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) problem, given a query sample of a person, the goal is to determine the correct identity based on a labeled gallery in which the person appears in different clothes. Several models tackle this challenge by extracting clothes-independent features. However, the performance of these models is still lower for the clothes-changing setting compared to the same-clothes setting in which the person appears with the same clothes in the labeled gallery. As clothing-related features are often dominant features in the data, we propose a new process we call Gallery Enrichment, to utilize these features. In this process, we enrich the original gallery by adding to it query samples based on their face features, using an unsupervised algorithm. Additionally, we show that combining ReID and face feature extraction modules alongside an enriched gallery results in a more accurate ReID model, even for query samples with new outfits that do not include faces. Moreover, we claim that existing CC-ReID benchmarks do not fully represent real-world scenarios, and propose a new video CC-ReID dataset called 42Street, based on a theater play that includes crowded scenes and numerous clothes changes. When applied to multiple ReID models, our method (GEFF) achieves an average improvement of 33.5% and 6.7% in the Top-1 clothes-changing metric on the PRCC and LTCC benchmarks. Combined with the latest ReID models, our method achieves new SOTA results on the PRCC, LTCC, CCVID, LaST and VC-Clothes benchmarks and the proposed 42Street dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-aware Attention and Visual Shielding Network for Cloth-changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08387v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that aims to retrieve pedestrians whose clothes are changed. Since the human appearance with different clothes exhibits large variations, it is very difficult for existing approaches to extract discriminative and robust feature representations. Current works mainly focus on body shape or contour sketches, but the human semantic information and the potential consistency of pedestrian features before and after changing clothes are not fully explored or are ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel semantic-aware attention and visual shielding network for cloth-changing person ReID (abbreviated as SAVS) is proposed where the key idea is to shield clues related to the appearance of clothes and only focus on visual semantic information that is not sensitive to view/posture changes. Specifically, a visual semantic encoder is first employed to locate the human body and clothing regions based on human semantic segmentation information. Then, a human semantic attention module (HSA) is proposed to highlight the human semantic information and reweight the visual feature map. In addition, a visual clothes shielding module (VCS) is also designed to extract a more robust feature representation for the cloth-changing task by covering the clothing regions and focusing the model on the visual semantic information unrelated to the clothes. Most importantly, these two modules are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, and more robust features can be extracted for cloth-changing persons. Compared with FSAM (published in CVPR 2021), this method can achieve improvements of 32.7% (16.5%) and 14.9% (-) on the LTCC and PRCC datasets in terms of mAP (rank-1), respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2108.04527</p></details> |
| **[Identity-Guided Collaborative Learning for Cloth-Changing Person Reidentification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04400v2)** | 2023-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloth-changing person reidentification (ReID) is a newly emerging research topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information), cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised clothing change adaptive person ReID](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03702v2)** | 2021-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clothing changes and lack of data labels are both crucial challenges in person ReID. For the former challenge, people may occur multiple times at different locations wearing different clothing. However, most of the current person ReID research works focus on the benchmarks in which a person's clothing is kept the same all the time. For the last challenge, some researchers try to make model learn information from a labeled dataset as a source to an unlabeled dataset. Whereas purely unsupervised training is less used. In this paper, we aim to solve both problems at the same time. We design a novel unsupervised model, Sync-Person-Cloud ReID, to solve the unsupervised clothing change person ReID problem. We developer a purely unsupervised clothing change person ReID pipeline with person sync augmentation operation and same person feature restriction. The person sync augmentation is to supply additional same person resources. These same person's resources can be used as part supervised input by same person feature restriction. The extensive experiments on clothing change ReID datasets show the out-performance of our methods.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Multigranular Visual-Semantic Embedding for Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04527v1)** | 2021-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Person reidentification (ReID) is a very hot research topic in machine learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail. To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task, but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme (MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic information that is used to align the human attributes.</p></details> |  |
